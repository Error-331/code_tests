# Day trading

## General

- Day trading (or investing) - buying and selling of financial products (stocks), commodities (such as oil or gold), or foreign currency electronically on financial markets;

- The markets are the grouping of financial trading people, products, and platforms;

- Market markers are traders whose profit is made from buying and selling all available stock in which they are dealers (hey earn a commission on each trade);

- Market makers are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the National Futures Association (NFA);

- Only these registered brokers are required to put their client’s financial needs above their own (FINRA/NFA);

- The buy prices are a bit higher than the sell prices; 

- The difference between the buy/sell is called bid/ask spread;

- If you are selling a stock, you’ll get the bid price; 

- If you are buying a stock, you’ll get the ask price;

- Financial products that are traded in massive quantities daily usually have a tight spread;

- The more often product is traded - the more liquid it is - the less the spread;

- The less often product is traded - the more illiquid it is - the wider the spread;

### Example

- you are buying one hundred shares of Apple stock (AAPL) at $101.50 per share;

- you instantly sold all one hundred of those AAPL shares, your sales price would be about $101.40;

- you would instantly lose ten cents per share, for a total loss of $10 on the trade

- this difference in price is the amount that the dealer or floor broker makes on the trade.
 
## Primary and Secondary markets

### Primary market

The primary market is where new stocks and bonds are first made available for public purchase. When a company is raising cash for operations for the first time, investors can 
pay cash for an equity ownership stake in the company, which is embodied in shares of stock. In return, the owners of the company give up a percentage of control of their company 
to the investors. The company then takes the cash and uses the money to grow further. This initial sale of stock is called an initial public offering, or IPO.

### Secondary market

Once the stock has been sold, it becomes a part of the secondary market, where it can be traded among investors and day traders with very few or no restrictions. Most times this 
is done through a brokerage account or an online trading platform. The money paid for a trade is given to the previous owner of the stock, and the purchasing trader receives 
the stock. The company that originally issued the stock never receives any money from the secondary market.
