# Swing trading

## Technical analysis

Reading a security price chart with volume and determining the security’s likely direction based on the strength of buyers and sellers.

Technical analysis questions:
- Is this security in a bull or bear market in the short and long term?
- Is the security trending or in a trading range?
- Who’s in control of the market - buyers or sellers?
- Is the strength of the buyers/sellers increasing or waning?
- What price point indicates a reversal or failure?
- What signals the time to enter?
- What signals the time to exit?

## Advantages

- Applies consistently across time and markets;
- Can be used on a single security in a short period of time;
- Incorporates the psychology of the crowd, whether rational or irrational;
- Allows for support and resistance levels for exits and entries;
- Involves low levels of subjectivity in the analysis of charts;

## Fundamental analysis

### Key points

- when a company reports its earnings;
- what company earnings expectations are; 
- no interest in every detail of a company’s balance sheet;
- high-level overview of the company;

## Traders

- Top-down trader finds securities by beginning at a macro level and drilling down to an industry and  then to a particular company;
- Bottom-up trader finds securities  at the bottom (individual companies) and then selecting the company that has the best industry group and macro-level fundamentals;

Example 1: 

1. select undervalued securities using fundamental screens;
2. vet those securities for strong or weak chart patterns;

Example 2:

1. identify strong or weak stocks using industry chart patterns;
2. investigate those securities to find the candidates that are most compelling to buy or short

## Market

- Market participants, acting alone, react similarly to major news;
- Market participants have memory (orders of traders may prevent orders from user from ever getting executed);
- Smart investors’ actions show up on the chart (usually institutional investors);

Example 1:

- the overwhelming supply of shares at that level will force the stock to retreat before reaching $100;
- place order at $98.71 - t’s unlikely that other traders placed an order at that specific price
