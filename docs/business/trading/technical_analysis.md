“3.2 Candlestick charts
Candlestick charts are further developed line charts that serve to compensate for the disadvantage of less information. Candlestick charts have their origin in 17th century Japan. Today, candlestick charts are the preferred tool of analysis for traders and most investors since they provide all the required information at a glance.

3.2.1 The candlestick
As the name suggests, a candlestick chart is made up of so-called (price) candlesticks. These candlesticks are made up of different components to describe the price movements of financial instruments.
Two sample candlesticks are shown in figure 5. A candlestick consists of a solid part, the body, and two thinner lines which are called candle wicks or candlestick shadows.
The candlesticks are color-coded to illustrate the direction of the price movements. A white candlestick represents rising prices, whereas a black candlestick shows that the price fell during the period.”



“The length of the shadows shows how much the price has moved up and down with respect to a candlestick within a specific duration. If we set our charts so that one candlestick corresponds to one day, then we can read the daily fluctuations in the financial market using the shadows of a candlestick.
The candlestick body describes the difference between the opening and closing prices for the corresponding time period.”

“The candlestick body describes the difference between the opening and closing prices for the corresponding time period.
The body of the white, rising candlestick in figure 6 shows that the price opened at $10 and closed at $20 in the selected time interval, but has fluctu”

“ated between $25 and $5 in the meantime, as indicated by the shadows.
”

“If we line up several candlesticks, we can reproduce the progression of line charts by following the candlestick bodies as shown in figure 7. The candle shadows also show the severity of price fluctuations in each case. We, thus, get all the information that is essential for an effective price analysis at a glance. This is why candlestick charts are mostly used for technical analysis these days.”


“The following chapters show how to interpret this information usefully to make actual trading decisions. Anyone who knows how to analyse and interpret the so-called candlestick patterns or candle formations, already understands the actions of the financial market players a little better.”
