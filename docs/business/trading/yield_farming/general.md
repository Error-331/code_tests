# Yield farming

- it involves lending (кредитование) or staking (размещение) your cryptocurrency coins or tokens to get rewards in the form of transaction fees (комиссии) or interest (процентов);
- similar to earning interest from a bank account (lending money to the bank);
- it is more riskier, volatile, and complicated unlike putting money in a bank;

## How does yield farming work?

Users (liquidity providers (LPs)) providing their cryptocurrencies for the functioning of the DeFi platform.

- LPs provide coins or tokens to a liquidity pool—a smart contract-based decentralised application (dApp) that contains all the funds;
- Once the LPs lock tokens into a liquidity fund they are awarded a fee or interest generated from the underlying DeFi platform the liquidity pool is on;
- The lending happens through smart contracts with no middleman or intermediator;
- The liquidity pool powers a marketplace where anyone can lend or borrow tokens; 
- The usage of these marketplace incurs fees from the users, and the fees are used to pay liquidity providers for staking their own tokens in the pool;
- While lenders can use the tokens as they wish, most lenders currently are **speculators** looking for **arbitrage opportunities** by cashing in on the token's fluctuations in the market;

## Returns (Как рассчитывается рентабельность доходного фарминга?)

- The estimated return(доход) in the yield farming process is calculated in terms of annual percentage yield (APY);
- It is the rate of return that the user gains over a year;
- Compound interest(сложные проценты) is also factored in the APY calculation;

## Risks of yield farming?

- Cyber theft; 
- Frauds;
- Lack of concrete policies;
- Volatility of tokens (volatility can also be in short bursts(всплески), so the price of a token can surge or cash when it is locked in the liquidity pool);
