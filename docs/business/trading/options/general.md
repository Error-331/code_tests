## Types

- listed stock options;

===  

A financial option is a contractual agreement (also known as a contract) between two parties.

listed options that trade on exchanges. Moreover, unlike stocks, which are about ownership of shares, option contracts give the owner rights and the seller obligations.



Call option: A call option gives the owner (seller) the right (obligation) to buy (sell) a specific number of shares of the underlying stock at a specific price by a predetermined date. A call option gives you the opportunity to profit from price gains in the underlying stock at a fraction of the cost of owning the stock.

Put option: Put options give the owner (seller) the right (obligation) to sell (buy) a specific number of shares of the underlying stock at a specific price by a specific date. If you own put options on a stock that you own and the price of the stock is falling, the put option is gaining in value, thus offsetting the losses on the stock and giving you an opportunity to make decisions about your stock ownership without panicking.


Rights of the owner of an options contract: A call option gives the owner the right to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a predetermined price. A put option gives its owner the right to sell a specific number of shares of stock at a predetermined price.

Obligations of an options seller: Sellers of call options have the obligation to sell a specific number of shares of the underlying stock at a predetermined price. Sellers of put options have the obligation to buy a specific amount of stock at a predetermined price.




Use stock options for the following objectives:

To benefit from upside moves for less money
To profit from downside moves in stocks without the risk of short selling
To protect an individual stock position or an entire portfolio during periods of falling prices and market downturns


Considering the risks

Option contracts have a limited life. Each contract has an expiration date. That means if the price move you anticipate doesn’t happen by the expiration date, you’ll lose your entire initial investment.

The wrong strategy can lead to losing trades. This can be in the form of major losses in any individual position — but not necessarily to your entire portfolio if you manage your position size (trade small number of contracts — one to two contracts versus five or six or more contracts at any time).


Comparing options to other securities
Options are a form of derivative, a type of security that derives its value from an underlying security. Stock options derive their value from the underlying stock. In order to better understand option valuations, it makes sense to know more about other derivatives and exchange-traded mutual funds (ETFs):

Commodities and futures contracts: Like options, commodity and futures contracts are agreements between two parties. The seller of an option is obligated to buy or sell stock if the option buyer exercises the option. That’s because commodities and futures contacts set the price for a predetermined quantity of a physical item to be delivered to a particular location on a predetermined date. Stock options have no delivery date in terms of bushels of anything. But if an option expires in the money (ITM), the option will be automatically exercised, and 100 shares per contract will be delivered to the buyer or seller by the intermediation of the broker, depending on whether the option is a call or a put. On the other hand, commodities and futures contracts are similar to options in that they lock in the price and quantity of an asset and have expiration dates. But in both cases, you can trade away your rights and obligations if you exit the contract before expiration.

Indexes: Think of indexes as collections of assets whose value is pooled together to measure the price of the group. Stocks, commodities, and futures are all index components. (Chapter 9 covers index options in detail.) Here is the important difference: Indexes aren’t securities. That means you can’t buy an index directly. Instead, you buy securities that track the value of the index, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that own the stocks in a particular index — for example, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are mutual funds that trade like stocks on an exchange. Most ETFs are designed to track an index or an underlying sector of a particular market. ETFs aren’t derivatives, but they can be considered quasi-derivatives, or almost derivatives, because they don’t always hold the exact same securities of the index that they track. For example, some leveraged ETFs use more exotic securities known as swaps to mimic the action of the underlying index while adding leverage. Two of the most popular ETFs are the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY) and the Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. These two popular ETFs let you trade their underlying indexes, directly or through options.

Stocks and bonds: Stock ownership gives you part of a company, whereas bond ownership makes you a debt holder. Each dynamic has its own set of risks and rewards. A comparison of the three assets, stocks, bonds, and options, yields a fairly straightforward picture. All three asset classes can lead investors to total loss of their investment. And though stocks give you a piece of the company and bonds offer you income, options offer you no ownership of any tangible assets. In the end, stocks offer indefinite holding periods, and bonds have a maturity date, whereas options have a limited life based on their expiration date.


A swap is an insurance contract where terms are privately agreed upon by the participants. They can be thought of as nonexchange traded options, and they can be used to bet on the direction of just about anything that the two parties agree upon. By design, swaps are sophisticated securities that aren’t available to individual investors because of the financial requirements and the specific agreements required to be signed before you trade them.
