# Mutual funds

- A mutual fund is a collection of investment money pooled from many investors to be invested for a specific objective;
- A mutual fund company is a type of financial intermediary;

## Pros

- They allow you to diversify your investments (invest in many different industries and companies instead of in just one or two);
- They enable you to hire the best money management firms and managers in the country to manage your money;

## Open-end funds

- open-end simply means the fund issues as many (or as few) shares as investors demand;
- open-end funds theoretically have no limit to the number of investors or the amount of money that they hold;
- **user can buy or sell open-end funds at a price determined once a day after the markets close**;
- open-end funds can afford to pay the necessary money to hire leading managers;
- open-end funds charge lower annual operating expenses;
- the value of a share of open-end fund (known as the net asset value) always equals 100 percent of what the fund’s investments (less liabilities) are currently worth;

## Closed-end funds

- closed-end funds are those where the mutual fund companies decide upfront, before they take on any investors, exactly how many shares they’ll issue;
- **after closed-end fund issue shares, the only way the user can purchase shares (or more shares) is to buy them from an existing investor through a broker**;
- closed-end funds and ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day;
- close-end funds and ETFs trade at market price, which is heavily influenced by the value of the specific investments they own but can vary a bit based on supply and demand;
- closed-end funds trade like securities on the stock exchange and because user must sell his shares to someone who wants to buy;
- closed-end funds sometimes sell at a discount;

## Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds

- ETFs trade like stocks on a stock exchange and thus can be bought or sold during the trading day when the financial markets are open;

## Lending investments

Interest on your money.

- lending is a type of investment in which the lender charges the borrower a fee (generally known as interest) until the original loan (typically known as the principal) gets paid back;
- lending investments include bank certificates of deposit (CDs), United States (U.S.) Treasury bills, and bonds issued by corporations;
- the original amount that the user loaned (principal) will be returned to the user in full on a specific date;

**Drawbacks:**

1. User may not get everything he were promised;
2. User get what he were promised, but because of the ravages of inflation, his money is simply worth less than he expected it to be worth;
3. User don’t share in the success of the organization to which he lent his money;

## Ownership investments:

More potential profit (and risk).

- user is an owner when he purchases an asset, whether a building or part of a multinational corporation, that has the ability to generate earnings or profits; 
- real estate and stock are common ownership investments;
- depreciation - investments can decline in value;

**Ways of profits:**

1. Through the investment’s own cash flow/income (real estate - rental income, stocks - dividends);
2. Through appreciation in the value of the investment (real estate and stocks can increase in price);

## Savings and money market accounts

- banks - savings and money market accounts;
- money market funds are available through mutual fund companies;
- lending investments based on short-term loans and are about the safest in terms of short-term risk;
- the interest rate (also known as the yield) paid on savings and money market accounts is low but doesn’t fluctuate as much over time;
- the interest rate on savings and money market accounts generally fluctuates as the level of overall market interest rates changes;
- bank savings accounts are backed by an independent agency of the federal government through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance;
- money market funds, however, aren’t insured;

## Bonds

- bond is nothing more than a company’s promise to repay borrowed money over a specified period of time at a specified interest rate;
- bond funds also account for about 20 percent of all mutual fund assets and about 15 percent of all exchange-traded funds;
- when issued, a bond includes a specified maturity date - the date when users principal is repaid;
- interest rate is typically fixed;
- bonds can fluctuate in value with changes in interest rates;

Bond generally pays higher rate of interest as compared with other bonds when it has:

1. Lower credit quality, which compensates for the higher risk of default and the higher likelihood that the user lose his investment;
2. Longer-term maturity, which compensates for the risk that the user will be unhappy with the bond’s interest rate if interest rates move up;
3. Callability, which retains an organization’s or company’s right to buy back (pay off) the issued bonds before the bonds mature;

Early payback is a risk to bondholders because they may get their investment money returned to them when interest rates have dropped.

**Differences:**

1. The type of institution to which user is lending money;
2. The credit quality of the borrower to whom user lends his money;
3. The length of maturity of the bond;

## Stocks

- represent shares of ownership in a company;

## Overseas/international investments

**Reasons to invest:**

1. Diversification;
2. Growth potential (the value of U.S. securities is now in the minority (at about 40 percent);

## Real estate

- if the local economy grows and more jobs are being produced at higher wages, real estate should do well;
- if companies in the community are laying off people and excess housing is sitting vacant because of previous overbuilding, rents and property values are likely to fall;

## Gold, silver, currencies, and the like

- commodities may produce hefty returns over the short term whenever bad things happen, especially inflation, credit crises, and international conflicts;
- over the very long-term, gold has kept investors just up with the rate of inflation - eking out an annualized return that is 0.5 percent per year above the rate of inflation;

## Annuities

- are investment products with some tax and insurance twists;
- they behave like savings accounts, except that they should give slightly higher yields, and insurance companies back them;
- an annuity gives no upfront tax deductions;
- annuities also charge relatively high fees;
