# Mutual funds

- A mutual fund is a collection of investment money pooled from many investors to be invested for a specific objective;
- A mutual fund company is a type of financial intermediary;
- sector funds, invest exclusively in stocks of a single industry (for instance, healthcare);
- fund risk of bankruptcy is nil;

## Pros

- They allow you to diversify your investments (invest in many different industries and companies instead of in just one or two);
- They enable you to hire the best money management firms and managers in the country to manage your money;

## Cons

- The investment Goliath - investors are prone to rash moves;
- Doing business long distance - old farts issue, everything is online now;
- Fund company scandals - fund companies that don’t place their shareholders’ interests first should be avoided;
- Volatility of investment balance;
- Mystery (risky) investments - some funds have betrayed their investors’ trust by taking unnecessary risks by investing in volatile financial instruments such as futures and options;
- Investments that charge fees that are too high - some funds charge extremely high annual operating expenses that put a real drag on returns;
- taxable distributions - the taxable distributions that funds produce can also be a negative;

## Open-end funds

- open-end simply means the fund issues as many (or as few) shares as investors demand;
- open-end funds theoretically have no limit to the number of investors or the amount of money that they hold;
- **user can buy or sell open-end funds at a price determined once a day after the markets close**;
- open-end funds can afford to pay the necessary money to hire leading managers;
- open-end funds charge lower annual operating expenses;
- the value of a share of open-end fund (known as the net asset value) always equals 100 percent of what the fund’s investments (less liabilities) are currently worth;

## Closed-end funds

- closed-end funds are those where the mutual fund companies decide upfront, before they take on any investors, exactly how many shares they’ll issue;
- **after closed-end fund issue shares, the only way the user can purchase shares (or more shares) is to buy them from an existing investor through a broker**;
- closed-end funds and ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day;
- close-end funds and ETFs trade at market price, which is heavily influenced by the value of the specific investments they own but can vary a bit based on supply and demand;
- closed-end funds trade like securities on the stock exchange and because user must sell his shares to someone who wants to buy;
- closed-end funds sometimes sell at a discount;

## Basic steps to perform before investing

1. Analyze company financial statements: financial reports of the companies (revenue, expenses, profits and losses, assets and liabilities, etc.);
2. Talk with the muckety-mucks: talk to the persons running the companies;
3. Analyze company and competitor strategies: the best fund managers and their researchers take a skeptical view of what a company’s execs say - they conduct own investigation work;
4. Talk with company customers, suppliers, competitors, and industry consultants;
5. Attend trade shows and review industry literature;
6. Take a disciplined approach:  Discipline and process provides skilled managers with a clear framework to take advantage of good opportunities that others miss;

## Types by asset

1. Stock funds: if the user wants his money to grow over a long period of time (and he can put up with some bad years thrown in with the good);
2. Bond funds: if the user needs current income and don’t want investments that fluctuate as widely in value as stocks do;
3. Money market funds: if the user wants to be sure that he invested principal doesn’t drop in value because he may need to use his money in the short term;

## Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds

- ETFs trade like stocks on a stock exchange and thus can be bought or sold during the trading day when the financial markets are open;

## Lending investments

Interest on your money.

- lending is a type of investment in which the lender charges the borrower a fee (generally known as interest) until the original loan (typically known as the principal) gets paid back;
- lending investments include bank certificates of deposit (CDs), United States (U.S.) Treasury bills, and bonds issued by corporations;
- the original amount that the user loaned (principal) will be returned to the user in full on a specific date;

**Drawbacks:**

1. User may not get everything he were promised;
2. User get what he were promised, but because of the ravages of inflation, his money is simply worth less than he expected it to be worth;
3. User don’t share in the success of the organization to which he lent his money;

## Ownership investments:

More potential profit (and risk).

- user is an owner when he purchases an asset, whether a building or part of a multinational corporation, that has the ability to generate earnings or profits; 
- real estate and stock are common ownership investments;
- depreciation - investments can decline in value;

**Ways of profits:**

1. Through the investment’s own cash flow/income (real estate - rental income, stocks - dividends);
2. Through appreciation in the value of the investment (real estate and stocks can increase in price);

## Savings and money market accounts

- banks - savings and money market accounts;
- money market funds are available through mutual fund companies;
- lending investments based on short-term loans and are about the safest in terms of short-term risk;
- the interest rate (also known as the yield) paid on savings and money market accounts is low but doesn’t fluctuate as much over time;
- the interest rate on savings and money market accounts generally fluctuates as the level of overall market interest rates changes;
- bank savings accounts are backed by an independent agency of the federal government through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance;
- money market funds, however, aren’t insured;

## Bonds

- bond is nothing more than a company’s promise to repay borrowed money over a specified period of time at a specified interest rate;
- bond funds also account for about 20 percent of all mutual fund assets and about 15 percent of all exchange-traded funds;
- when issued, a bond includes a specified maturity date - the date when users principal is repaid;
- interest rate is typically fixed;
- bonds can fluctuate in value with changes in interest rates;

Bond generally pays higher rate of interest as compared with other bonds when it has:

1. Lower credit quality, which compensates for the higher risk of default and the higher likelihood that the user lose his investment;
2. Longer-term maturity, which compensates for the risk that the user will be unhappy with the bond’s interest rate if interest rates move up;
3. Callability, which retains an organization’s or company’s right to buy back (pay off) the issued bonds before the bonds mature;

Early payback is a risk to bondholders because they may get their investment money returned to them when interest rates have dropped.

**Differences:**

1. The type of institution to which user is lending money;
2. The credit quality of the borrower to whom user lends his money;
3. The length of maturity of the bond;

## Stocks

- represent shares of ownership in a company;

## Overseas/international investments

**Reasons to invest:**

1. Diversification;
2. Growth potential (the value of U.S. securities is now in the minority (at about 40 percent);

## Real estate

- if the local economy grows and more jobs are being produced at higher wages, real estate should do well;
- if companies in the community are laying off people and excess housing is sitting vacant because of previous overbuilding, rents and property values are likely to fall;

## Gold, silver, currencies, and the like

- commodities may produce hefty returns over the short term whenever bad things happen, especially inflation, credit crises, and international conflicts;
- over the very long-term, gold has kept investors just up with the rate of inflation - eking out an annualized return that is 0.5 percent per year above the rate of inflation;

## Annuities

- are investment products with some tax and insurance twists;
- they behave like savings accounts, except that they should give slightly higher yields, and insurance companies back them;
- an annuity gives no upfront tax deductions;
- annuities also charge relatively high fees;

## Pre research phase

### Mistakes

1. Selecting funds that didn't user goals;
2. Adjustments of spending habits;
3. Taking a loan before investing in funds;
4. Not taking into account health insurance;
5. Not purchasing sufficient liability protection from lawsuits;

### Steps

1. Determine savings rate (how much money you save per year);
2. Examine spending and income;
3. Determine your tax bracket;
4. Assess the risk;
5. Review current investment holdings;
6. Consider other 'investment' possibilities;


If you need to tap in to the money within two or three years or less, a money
market or short-term bond fund may fill the bill.
»»If your time horizon falls between three and seven years, you want to focus on
bond funds.
»»For long-term goals, seven or more years down the road, stock funds are
probably your main ticket.

Stock picking takes significant research time and expense. Before
buying an individual security (stock or bond), you should know a great deal
about the company you’re investing in. Relevant questions that you need to
answer include
• What products or services does the company sell?
• What are the company’s prospects for future growth and profitability?
• How does the company’s performance compare to its competitors’
performances — both recently and over the long haul?
• Are technological or other changes in the works that might harm or
improve its business?
• How much debt does the company have?

Finding the Best Funds

The charges you pay to buy or sell a fund and the ongoing fund-operating expenses
have a big impact on the rate of return you ultimately earn on your investments
because fees are deducted from your investment returns.

All other things being
equal, high fees and other expenses reduce your returns. You can and should
examine a fund’s expenses and fees before you buy into it.

In contrast, past performance
is actually a relatively poor indicator of a fund’s likely future returns.
(Later in this chapter, I discuss how many of yesterday’s star funds turn into
tomorrow’s losers or mediocre performers.) You just can’t know what tomorrow
will bring.

Although you have no idea how much of a return you’ll make, you can find out,
before buying a fund, how much the fund has been charging in fees — both
upfront (in the form of sales commissions) and ongoing (in the form of fund
operating expenses). Factor these known reductions in returns into your fundbuying
decisions.

Studies have shown that, on average, load funds underperform no-loads.

I’ll do a financial plan for you to determine your needs. Try as they may,
investment salespeople can’t perform objective, conflict-free financial
planning. (You should never pay for a “financial plan” from an investment
salesperson.) The problem with sales loads is the power of self-interest
(discussed in Chapter 9). This issue is rarely talked about, but brokers’
self-interest is even more important than the extra costs you pay.

Exposing loads
The only way to be sure that a fund is truly no-load is to look at the prospectus for
the fund. Only there, in black and white and absent of all marketing hype, must the
organization tell the truth about its sales charges and other fund fees. (Check out
Chapter 8.)

The Class B shares don’t have an upfront commission but instead have a deferred
sales charge, which decreases over time. However, note that this class can charge
you up to an extra 1 percent per year (12b-1 marketing expense fees). Class B
shares in this example (as in most real cases) cost you more in the long run
because you pay this cost each year as long as you own the fund. Check out the
“Hidden loads in alphabet soup: ABCD shares” sidebar for even more details on
this game of hide the load.


Considering a fund’s operating expenses
One cost of fund ownership that you simply can’t avoid is operating expenses. Every
fund — load and no-load — has operational costs: paying the fund manager and
research assistants, employing people to answer the phone lines and operate a
website, printing and mailing prospectuses, buying technology equipment to
track all those investments and customer-account balances, and so on.

Running a fund business costs money! Fund fees also include a profit for the fund
company, so in that respect it’s not technically accurate that the fund’s “operating
expenses” also include profits. (The brokerage costs that a fund pays to buy
and sell securities aren’t included in a fund’s operating expenses. You can find
this information in a fund’s Statement of Additional Information, which I discuss
in Chapter 8.)


A fund’s operating expenses are quoted as a percentage of the fund’s assets or
value. The percentage represents the annual fee or charge. In the case of load
funds, this fee is in addition to the stated load. You can find this number in the
expenses section of a fund’s prospectus, usually denoted by a line, such as Total
Fund Operating Expenses. Alternatively, you can generally locate this information
on most fund companies’ websites, or you can call the fund’s toll-free number
and ask a representative. I detail what the operating expenses are for the funds
recommended in this book.

Some people ask me how the expenses are charged and whether they’re itemized
on your fund statement. The answer is that a fund’s operating expenses are
essentially invisible to you because they’re deducted before you’re paid any return
so you won’t see them itemized on your fund statements. Because these expenses
are effectively charged on a daily basis, you don’t need to worry about trying to get
out of a fund before these fees are deducted.

Expenses are critical on money market and bond funds. These funds are
buying securities that are so similar and so efficiently priced in the financial
markets. In other words, your expected returns from similar bond and money
funds are largely driven by the size of a fund’s operating expenses. This fact
has been especially true in recent years with such low interest rates.

With stock funds, expenses are a less important (but still important)
factor in picking a fund. Don’t forget that, over time, stocks have averaged
returns of about 9 percent per year. So if one stock fund charges 1 percent
more in operating expenses than another, you’re giving up an extra 11 percent
of your expected annual pre-tax returns and an even greater portion of your
after-tax returns.

These high-expense funds have another insidious danger built in: To produce
returns comparable to those of similar funds with lower costs, the manager of
such a high-cost fund may take extra risks to overcome the performance drag of
high expenses. So on top of reducing a fund’s returns, higher expenses may expose
you to greater risk than you desire.

In some cases, a fund (particularly a newer one that’s trying to attract assets) will
temporarily “reimburse” a portion of its expense ratio to show a lower cost. But
when the fund terminates this reimbursement, you’re stuck owning shares in a
fund that has higher costs than you intended to pay.

Choosing funds on simplistic comparisons of performance numbers
is dangerous.

Before you invest in a fund,
make sure you’re comfortable with the level of risk the fund is taking on.


Short-term (one year is a short time period) fund performance numbers don’t
mean much — luck can be just as big a factor as skill. Also remember that earning
much higher returns than other similar funds often means that the manager took
a lot of risk. The greater the short-term returns for that fund and manager, the
greater the odds of sharp slump.

The trick is picking the correct benchmark for comparison. Dozens of market
indexes and fund category averages measure various components of the market.
You always want to compare a fund’s returns to its most appropriate benchmark.

In the great advertising tradition, fund
companies often pick benchmarks that make it easy for their funds to look good.
And in like manner, more than a few investment advisors who manage money do
the same, as I discuss in Chapter 23.

You should also be suspicious of any bond fund
claiming to be this good with an annual operating expense ratio of 0.8 percent.

Using Fund Publications

Reading Prospectuses — the Important Stuff, Anyway

The most valuable information — the fund’s investment objectives, costs, and
performance history — is summarized in the first few pages of the prospectus.
Read these. Skip most of the rest.

a summary prospectus which
in about just 10 pages covers the important details in the longer form or traditional
prospectus. 

Here is the order in which fund companies are required to disclose information in
their prospectuses:
1. Investment objectives/goals
2. Fee table
3. Investments, risks, and performance
4. Management — investment advisors and portfolio managers
5. Purchase and sale of fund shares
6. Tax information
7. Financial intermediary compensation

If a so-called financial advisor pitches a fund, but you’re not sure whether they
get paid for selling it to you, always get a prospectus and check out the fund
expense section. That way, you can see if commissions will erode your returns. In
this case, you’d see that if an advisor recommended this fund, they wouldn’t be
paid any commission — a good sign. (Refer to Chapter 7 for an example of a typical
load-fund fee table.)

The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price per share of the fund. Tracking this value
provides an incomplete, terrible measure of what you would’ve earned in the fund.
Why? Just look at the distributions section, which details all the money paid out to
shareholders each year. This fund has paid out total distributions (dividends and
capital gains) of $12.38 per share over this five-year period. This per-share figure
is a significant amount when you consider that the share price increased from
$39.00 to $46.10 during the period — an 18.2 percent increase. So if you add in the
distributions to the change in share price, now you’re talking about a 50 percent
(or more) increase (if you’d reinvested these distributions, you would’ve had an
even greater return).

The Total Return represents what investors in the fund have earned historically.
The returns on this type of fund, which invests in stocks and bonds, bounce
around from year to year. You can see how the total investments (Net Assets) in the
fund have changed over time. Assets can increase from new money flowing into
the fund as well as from an increase in the value of a fund’s shares.

This section of a prospectus also shows you how a fund’s annual operating
expenses (Ratio of Total Expenses to Average Net Assets) have changed over time.
They should decrease when a fund is growing. This fund’s expense ratio of
0.25 percent in 2016 decreased to 0.24 percent four years later. If operating
expenses are high (not in this case) and don’t decrease, their persistent levels
may signal a company that maximizes its profits because of the fund’s popularity.
For funds that are only a few years old, expenses may remain higher because
the fund is building its base of investors. (The slight increase for this fund isn’t
significant and was due in part to the high return of the most recent year, which
increased the fund manager’s performance fee payments.)

The line Ratio of Net Investment Income to Average Net Assets shows the annual dividends,
or yield, that the fund has paid. (This figure is especially important for
retired people, who need income to live on.) In this example, the downward trend
merely reflects the overall decline in interest rates during the period. If you looked
at this ratio for a similar fund, you’d see the same trend for this period.

The Portfolio Turnover Rate tells you how much trading takes place in a fund. Specifically,
it measures the percentage of the portfolio’s holdings that has been
traded over the year:

A low turnover number (less than 30 percent or so) for most years, such as
the one for this fund, denotes a fund with more of a buy-and-hold strategy.

A high turnover number (100 percent plus) indicates a fund manager who
does a lot of trading. Rapid trading is costlier and riskier and may increase a
fund’s taxable distributions.


====

Reviewing Annual Reports

Funds also produce annual reports that discuss how the fund’s been doing and
provide details on the specific investments that a fund holds. Look at the annual
report if, for instance, you want to know which countries an international fund is
currently invested in.

The Composite Index is a mythical investment, which has
the advantage of not having any costs deducted from it.


=====

Investment holdings

The Statement of Net Assets section lists every investment the fund owns. Here’s
where you get the details that tell you exactly where your money is invested. You
can see here the incredible diversification your money gets in a mutual fund; you
actually own a tiny sliver of each of these securities if you invest in this fund (see
Figure 8-13). For example, in this first section, you can see that this fund (as of
November 30, 2021) was 66 percent invested in stocks, which are presented here
by industry.

Reviewing a fund’s specific investment holdings is important. Sometimes, a
fund’s name is misleading relative to what the fund actually holds; often, the
Objective section of a prospectus doesn’t provide insight into important factors,
such as the sizes of the companies that it owns.

For each security, you also can see how much each investment was worth at the
end of the most recent year. (Do you need to know, should you care, and will it be
on the test? No, no, and no!)

Investigating the Statement of
Additional Information (SAI)

Although fund brokerage costs are typically far less than the fund’s operating
expenses, funds that frequently trade or “turn over” their holdings can have significant
brokerage expenses. These costs are disclosed in a fund’s Statement of
Additional Information (SAI). More trades mean more costs draining your returns,
which may also lead to more taxable distributions. Rest assured that the funds
recommended in this book have relatively low overall expenses including brokerage
fees.

Buying Funds from the Best Firms

The Vanguard Group

Because of Vanguard’s unique shareholder-owned structure (see the nearby sidebar
“Vanguard’s roots: The Bogle difference”), the average operating-expense
ratio of its funds — 0.19 percent per year for U.S. stock funds, 0.23 percent for
international stock funds, and 0.14 percent for bond funds — is lower than that of
any other fund family in the industry. In fact, the average fund family’s expense
ratio is a whopping four times higher than Vanguard’s. Vanguard also offers its
Admiral series of funds with lower expense ratios for higher-balance customers
and low-cost exchange-traded funds (see Chapter 5).

In the early 1970s when Vanguard was formed, the late John Bogle, its founder and
former CEO, made the big decision that to this day clearly differentiates Vanguard from
its competition: Vanguard distributes funds and provides shareholder administration on
an at-cost basis — that is, with no markup.
Bogle insisted that the management of most of the actively managed stock funds be
contracted out to private money management firms, with whom Vanguard would negotiate
the best deals. Thus, Vanguard’s fund investors would own the management company.
Contrast this arrangement to that of traditional fund companies, in which the
parent management company receives the profits from managing the funds.
Bogle felt that this unique corporate structure ensured that fund shareholders would
obtain the best deals possible on money managers. “Funds ought to be run for the benefit
of shareholders, not for the fund managers,” Bogle reasoned. History has proven
Bogle not only to be right but also to be a fund investor’s best advocate.

Vanguard is best at funds appealing to safety-minded investors — those who
want to invest in money market, bond, and conservative stock funds. However,
Vanguard also offers some more aggressive stock funds with solid performance
and low-expense ratios (see Chapter 13 for the list). In managing stock funds,
where performance is supposed to be more closely tied to the genius of the fund
manager, Vanguard’s thriftiness enhances performance.
