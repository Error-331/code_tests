# BakerySwap (BAKE)

- it is a **decentralized exchange** (DEX) that adopts the **automated market maker** (AMM) model;
- there is no **order book** to match buyers and sellers;
- users who add liquidity to these pools receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in exchange, according to their share of the pool;
- users can then convert these LP tokens back to the original tokens they supplied;
- **in exchange for providing liquidity, users earn trading fees**;

## Farming

- by staking BAKE or by providing liquidity to one of the pools, and then staking liquidity pool tokens (BLP);

Example:

- if user will provide liquidity to the **DOT-BNB** pool, he will receive **DOT-BNB** **BLP tokens**;
- user can then stake these BLP tokens to farm BAKE;
