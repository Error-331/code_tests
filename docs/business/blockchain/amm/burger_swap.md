# BurgerSwap (BURGER)

BurgerSwap is a DeFi protocol running on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BurgerSwap works as a decentralized exchange (DEX) that adopts the automated market maker (AMM) model. 

- there is no usual Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens on BurgerSwap;
- everyone who provides liquidity to eligible pairs receives BURGER tokens that represent their share of the pool;

## BurgerSwap Pool

- any user can provide liquidity (add tokens) to the BurgerSwap platform;
- these tokens can be used to create a new liquidity pool or be added to an existing one;
- when the user adds liquidity to a pool, he receives BURGER tokens proportionally to his pool share;

## BurgerSwap Cross-Chain Bridge

- BurgerSwap runs on BSC;
- user can only trade or provide liquidity using BEP-20 tokens;
- BurgerSwap offers a Cross-Chain Bridge service that allows user to convert any ERC-20 token into a wrapped BEP-20 version (bTokens);
- bTokens can only be traded if there is enough liquidity provided to their respective BNB and BURGER pairs (bToken/BNB and bToken/BURGER);
- trading pairs with low liquidity will likely incur a high amount of **slippage** on your trades;
