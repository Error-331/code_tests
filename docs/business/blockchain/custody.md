# Custody

Custody refers to the holding of assets on behalf of a client, generally by some form of institution.

- the use of a custodial service can be desirable to an asset holder, as it mitigates security risks like theft or loss;
- custodians tend to differ from banks as they’re unable to leverage the assets they hold to their **own ends**;
- the institution will generally impose a fee for the safekeeping of the assets;
- this may also cover their sale at the client’s behest(повеление);
- in **cryptocurrency**, custodial solutions are those where a third party holds the **private keys** to the **user’s funds**;
- virtually all exchanges employ a custodial approach;
- custodial solutions may be safer for new users that are inexperienced with key management;
