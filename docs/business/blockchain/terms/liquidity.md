# Liquidity

- is the measure of how easily user can convert an asset into cash or another asset;
- if a market is illiquid, it can be quite difficult to execute trades without causing a significant impact on price;
- **good liquidity** means that an asset can be quickly and easily bought or sold without having much **effect on its price**;
- **bad or low liquidity** means that an asset can't be bought or sold quickly;
- in a traditional sense, there are two types of liquidity â€“ accounting liquidity and market liquidity;

## Accounting liquidity

- is a term that's mostly used in the context of businesses and their balance sheets;
- it refers to the ease with which a company can pay its short-term debts and current liabilities with its current assets and cash flow;
- accounting liquidity is directly related to the financial health of a company;

## Market liquidity

- is the extent to which a market allows for assets to be bought and sold at fair prices;
- these are the prices that are the closest to the intrinsic value of the assets;
- intrinsic value - the lowest price a seller is willing to sell at (ask) is close to the highest price a buyer is willing to buy at (bid);

## Bid-Ask spread

- is the difference between the lowest ask and the highest bid;
- a low bid-ask spread is desirable for liquid markets;
- bid-ask spread can also be useful for the so-called arbitrage traders;
- arbitrage traders ensure that there aren't big price differences between the same market pairs on different exchanges;
- a **financial crisis** can have a significant impact on liquidity as market players rush to the exit to cover their financial obligations or short-term liabilities;
