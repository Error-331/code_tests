# Market capitalization

- refers to a metric that measures the relative size of a cryptocurrency;
- **it is calculated by multiplying the current market price of a particular coin or token with the total number of coins in circulation**;
- it is important to note that it is not the same as money inflow;
- it does not represent how much money is in the market;
- relatively small variation in price may affect the market cap significantly;
- a high-volume and liquid market cannot be easily manipulated because there are many orders in the order book and possibly a big volume of orders within the different ranges of price;
- a thin order book of a low-volume market could be easily overpassed with a relatively small amount of money, causing a significant impact on both the price and market cap;
