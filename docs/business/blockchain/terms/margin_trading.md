# Margin Trading

- is a method of trading assets using funds provided by a third party;
- margin accounts allow traders to access greater sums of capital, allowing them to **leverage** their positions;

## Principle of operation

- when a margin trade is initiated, the trader will be required to commit a percentage of the total order value;
- initial investment is known as the margin (closely related to the **concept of leverage**);
- margin trading accounts are used to create leveraged trading, and the leverage describes the ratio of borrowed funds to the margin;
- while the margin position is open, the traderâ€™s assets act as **collateral** for the borrowed funds;
- most brokerages reserve the right to force the sale **collateral** in case the market moves against their position;

**Example:** to open a **$100,000** trade at a leverage of **10:1**, a trader would need to commit **$10,000** of their capital;
