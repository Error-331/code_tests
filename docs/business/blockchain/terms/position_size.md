# Position Size

- _account size_ - **available capital** that the user can allocate to a particular trading strategy;
- _account risk_ - what percentage of the **available capital** user is willing to risk on a single trade;

## The 2% rule

- is an investing strategy;
- **a trader shouldn’t risk more than 2% of their account on a single trade**;
- is a strategy suitable for investment styles that typically involve entering only a **few**, **longer-term** positions;

## How to calculate position size

- **Account size** – $5000;
- **Account risk** – 1%;
- **Invalidation point** (distance to stop-loss) – 5% (when the market goes against us by 5%, we exit the trade and take the $50 loss);

Formula: `position size = account size x account risk / invalidation point`

Position size: 

`position size = $5000 x 0.01 / 0.05`

`$1000 = $5000 x 0.01 / 0.05`

- user also need to take into account the fees he is going to pay;
- user should also think about potential **slippage**, especially if he is trading a lower **liquidity** instrument;

Invalidation point to increased to 10%:

`position size = $5000 x 0.01 / 0.1`

`$500 = $5000 x 0.01 / 0.1`
