# Scalping

- is short-term trading strategy;
- **scalp traders** aim to harvest profits from small price moves;
- their goal isnâ€™t to make a lot of profit with each trade, but small profits over and over again;
- scalp traders may place **many trades over short periods**, looking for small price moves and market inefficiencies;
- the idea is that by stacking and compounding these small gains, the profits will add up over time to a significant amount;
- scalpers exploit short-term bursts of volatility rather than larger price moves;

## Principle of operation

- most common technical indicators: **moving averages**, **the Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, **Bollinger Bands**, **the VWAP**, and **the Fibonacci retracement tool**;
- scalpers will also use **real-time order book analysis**, **volume profile**, **open interest**, and other **complex indicators**;
- **scalping is about finding small opportunities in the market and exploiting them**;
- scalpers will typically trade lower time frames (1-hour, 15-minute, 5-minute, or even the 1-minute chart);
- most scalpers will still look at the high time frame market structure first (outline the important high time frame levels);
- then zoom in to look for the scalp trading setups;

## Scalping trading strategies

- there are two types of scalp traders - **discretionary** and **systematic** scalp traders;
- discretionary traders make trading decisions "on the spot," as the market unfolds before them;
- **discretionary traders may consider many different factors, but the rules are less rigid, and they rely more on intuition and gut feeling**;
- systematic traders have a well-defined trading system that essentially triggers entry and exit points for them;
- if certain conditions of their ruleset are met, they enter or exit a trade;
- systematic traders rely less on intuition and more on data and algorithms;
- range trading - traders wait for a price range to be established and trade within that range;
- good scalp traders will prepare for a breakout from the range by setting a **stop-loss**;
- exploiting the bid-ask spread - if there is a considerable difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask, scalpers can profit off that;
