# Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

- is an investment strategy that aims to reduce the impact of volatility on the purchase of assets;
- it involves buying equal fiat amounts of the asset at regular intervals;
- **buying at regular intervals can smooth out the average price**;
- in the long term, such a strategy reduces the negative impact that a bad entry may have on ones investment;
- **it undoubtedly performs best when the markets experience big swings**;
- dollar-cost averaging can have a dampening effect on gains in an uptrend;

## Why to use

- it reduces the risk of making a bet at the wrong time;
- **the idea is only to smooth the entry into the market so that the risk of bad timing is minimized**;

## Example

- user have fixed dollar amount of **$10,000**;
- user will invest into **Bitcoin**;
- he thinks that the price will likely range in the current zone, and it’s a favorable place to accumulate and build a position using a DCA strategy;
- user could divide the $10,000 up into 100 chunks of $100;
- each day, user is going to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin, no matter what the price;
- this way, he is going to spread out our entry to a period of about three months;
- **Bitcoin** has just entered a **bear market**, and the user don’t expect a prolonged bull trend for at least another **two years**;
- user expects a bull trend eventually, and he would like to prepare in advance;
- user could divide the investment into 100 chunks of $100 again;
- this time, user is going to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin each week;
- there are more or less 52 weeks in a year, so the entire strategy will execute over a little less than **two years**;
- user will build up a long-term position while the downtrend runs its course;
- user is not going to miss the train when the uptrend starts, and he will also mitigate some of the risks of buying in a downtrend;
- this strategy can be risky - user is buying in a downtrend after all;
