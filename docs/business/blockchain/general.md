# Bitcoin

- the underlying technology of Bitcoin is blockchain, which is a type of digital ledger;
- you own bitcoin through the means of a private key; 
- make sure you store the private key in a safe place; 
- Bitcoin account - is somewhat like a computer email having 27-34 letters and words;

## Private and public key generation

- A theoretical or random number being generated and used with a length that depends on the algorithm size of the cryptocurrency's technology requirements;
- The number is then converted to a private key using the specific requirements of the cryptocurrency cryptography algorithm requirement;
- A public key is then generated from the private key using whichever cryptographic algorithm requirements are required;
- The private key is utilised by the owner to access and send cryptocurrency and is private to the owner;
- The public key is to be shared to any third party to receive cryptocurrency;
- The private key and public key pair (known as an address) are not known by the blockchain or anyone else; 
- The blockchain will only record the transaction of the public address when cryptocurrency is sent to it;

### Seed phrases

In modern convention a seed phrase is now utilised which is a random 12 to 24 (or even greater) list of dictionary words which is an unencrypted form of the private key. (Words are easier to memorize than numerals.) When online, exchange and hardware wallets are generated using random numbers, and a seed phrase is asked to be recorded by the user, hence when access to the wallet becomes misplaced, damaged or compromised, the seed phrase can be used to re-access the wallet and associated keys and cryptocurrency en toto.

## Coins and Tokens

### Coin

- A coin usually is native to a blockchain and is used to trade currency and store value;
- Coins directly represent a proposed medium of exchange;
- Crypto coin transactions are handled by blockchain;
- A coin doesn't have to be moved from one place to another;
- All transactions are recorded on blockchains;
- A coin denotes what a person capable to own;

### Token

- A token tends to use another coin's blockchain (several other tokens like **BAT** and **Loopring** operate on **Ethereum**);
- Tokens, represent an asset; 
- Tokens can be held for value, or traded and staked to earn interest (Uniswap, Chainlink, Polygon and etc.); 
- Tokens rely on smart contracts for trade;
- When a token is spent, it moves from one place to another (NFTs);  
- A token represents what a person owns;
