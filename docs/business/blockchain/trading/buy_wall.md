# Bay wall

A buy wall is the result of a single huge buy order or the composition of multiple large buy orders that are put at the same price in the order book of a particular market.

- buy walls prevents market prices from dropping because they create a massive amount of orders at the same price which requires large amounts of money to be executed and passed over;
- usually occur when **large holders** (whales) of any cryptocurrency want to control the prices to the best of their interest;
- if a big buy wall for Bitcoin is placed at **$5,000.00**, other traders that are willing to buy tend to place their order at **$5,000.01** or above;
- they do so because they believe there is a very small probability of their orders being filled if placed together or behind the wall (at **$4,999.99** or less);
- in practice, however, most buy and sell walls only appear for a short period of time, and their orders are **not filled entirely**;
- **automated trading algorithms** (trading bots) are likely to be responsible for that;
- when a **bearish market** downtrend is really strong, buy walls can be quickly **eaten up**, having all their orders filled in a matter of seconds;
