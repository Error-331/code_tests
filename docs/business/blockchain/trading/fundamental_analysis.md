# Fundamental Analysis (FA)

Fundamental analysis (FA) is a method used by investors and traders in financial markets to assess the intrinsic value of an asset or business by examining as most qualitative 
and quantitative factors as possible, such as company management and reputation, industry health, market capitalization, and other economic factors.

Goal: determine whether or not the price of an asset is overvalued or undervalued (come up with a quantitative price that can be compared against the actual price);
Basis: the future potential of an asset should be based on more than just prior performance;

- FA seeks to determine how external factors can affect the performance of a company or project;
- seeks to better understand the industry-specific market and the future potential of a product or service in that market;
