# Dark pools

A dark pool is a private venue facilitating the exchange of financial instruments. It differs from a public exchange in that there is no visible order book, and trades are not 
publicly visible.

- majority of dark pool trading is done in block trades;
- a block trade is a transaction of a large quantity of an asset at a predetermined price;
- mostly used by institutional investors who trade large numbers of securities;
- dark pools allows institutions to place orders and make trades without publicly revealing their intentions first;

## Advantages

- **decreased impact on market sentiment** - traders wishing to trade large size can conceal their intentions from the wider investing public;
- **price improvement** - matching of trades is often done based on the average of the best available bid and ask price;
- **no slippage** - trading is done in block trades at predetermined prices;

## Controversies

- **conflict of interest** - there is no guarantee that a trade was executed at the best possible price (ability to obscure real market prices);
- **detrimental effect on market prices** - if the majority of trading happens in dark pools, the prices on public exchanges may not reflect the actual market;
- **vulnerability to high-frequency traders** - if they have privileged access to order book data, they can front-run large orders and take advantage of unsuspecting traders;
- **smaller average trade size** - since their emergence in the 1980s, the average trade size of dark pools has significantly decreased;

Note on "Vulnerability to high-frequency traders"

_Dark pools also enable another method called **pinging**, which includes sending a large number of small orders to map out a large hidden order. It is used to gauge areas of liquidity in 
the order book and gives high-frequency traders an advantage that can be considered unhealthy for the market._

## Decentralized dark pools

- decentralized dark pools can have the advantage of more secure digital verification methods;
- decentralized dark pool protocols could maintain a fair market price for all participants without the possibility of price manipulation;
- cross-chain **atomic swaps** could be used to facilitate the trades without the need for an intermediary;
- decentralized dark pools could also employ other novel cryptographic technologies such as **zero-knowledge proofs** to verify the integrity of dark pool transactions;
- allow traders to execute larger trades with no **slippage** (illiquid cryptocurrency markets);
