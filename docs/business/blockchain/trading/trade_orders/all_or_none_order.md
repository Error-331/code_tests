# All or None Order (AON)

- is an order made on a financial exchange to buy or sell a volume of assets for a set price;
- **All or None order** is placed with a specific instruction as to how that order should be filled;
- **once placed, must either be filled in its entirety or not at all**;
- this prevents any **partial filling** of orders and gives the buyer or seller the confidence of the **fixed execution price** for the **entire volume**;
