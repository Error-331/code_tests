# Fill Or Kill Order (FOK)

- an order must be filled immediately in its entirety or not executed at all;
- **FOK orders**, unlike **AON orders** don’t have a specific focus on the immediate point in time;
- Fill or Kill orders are often used when a trader doesn’t want to accept partial delivery of assets;

**Example:**

- Alice wants to set up an altcoin masternode immediately;
- but one of the requirements for running a masternode is that she must hold **1000 units** of that particular **cryptocurrency**;
- if time was not a limiting factor, Alice could place numerous buy orders until the 1000 threshold is eventually reached;
- since she wants the masternode up and running without too much delay, she can place multiple Fill or Kill buy orders for 1000 units of the altcoin (in different exchanges);
- this way, Alice will only pay for the altcoins if she gets the 1,000 units she wants and this allows her to cancel any order that is not filled in its entirety;
