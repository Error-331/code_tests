# Bid-Ask Spread

It is the gap between the lowest **asking price** (sell order) and the highest **bid price** (buy order);

- it can be created by a broker (or trading intermediary) as a way to monetize for their service;
- it can be created just by the differences between the limit orders placed by traders on an open market;
- the bid-ask spread is a common way of monetizing from trading activities;
- high volume markets have a lower spread because of their higher liquidity;
- markets that are not liquid enough and present low trading volume tend to have a more significant spread;
