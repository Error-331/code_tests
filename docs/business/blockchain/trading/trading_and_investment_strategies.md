# Trading and Investment Strategies

## Trading strategy

- is simply a plan you follow when executing trades;
- each strategy will largely depend on the trader’s profile and preferences;
- establishing a plan is crucial, it outlines clear goals and can prevent user from going off course due to emotion;

## Portfolio management

- portfolio management concerns itself with the creation and handling of a collection of investments;
- the portfolio itself is a grouping of assets – it could contain anything from **Beanie Babies** to **real estate**;

## Risk management

- _Market risk_ - the potential losses you could experience if the asset loses value;
- _Liquidity risk_ - the potential losses arising from illiquid markets, where you cannot easily find buyers for your assets;
- _Operational risk_ - the potential losses that stem from operational failures(human error, hardware/software failure, or intentional fraudulent conduct by employees);
- _Systemic risk_ - the potential losses caused by the failure of players in the industry you operate in, which impacts all businesses in that sector;

## Day trading

- is a strategy that involves entering and exiting positions within the same day;
- day trading in the context of cryptocurrency tends to refer to a trading style where the trader enters and exits positions within 24 hours;
- because profits in such a short period can be minimal, user may opt to trade across a wide range of assets to try and maximize your returns;
- day trading is generally better suited to experienced traders;

## Swing trading

- positions are typically held anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of months;
- the goal here will be to identify an asset that looks undervalued and is likely to increase in value;
- or user can try to find overvalued assets that are likely to decrease in value;
- many swing traders use **technical analysis**, however, because their strategy plays out across a longer period, **fundamental analysi**s may also be a valuable tool;
- **swing trading tends to be a more beginner-friendly strategy**;

## Position trading

- position (or trend) trading is a long-term strategy;
- traders purchase assets to hold for **extended periods** (generally measured in **months**);
- their goal is to make a profit by selling those assets at a higher price in the future;
- position traders are concerned with trends that can be observed over extended periods;
- it’s not uncommon to see position traders favor **fundamental analysis**, purely because their time preference allows them to watch fundamental events materialize;
- that’s not to say **technical analysis** isn’t used;

## Scalping

- scalping takes place across the smallest time frames;
- scalpers attempt to game small fluctuations in price, often entering and exiting positions within minutes (or even seconds);
- in most cases, they’ll use **technical analysis** to try and predict price movements and exploit **bid-ask spread** and other inefficiencies to make a profit;
- **scalping is by no means a beginner’s strategy**;
- **an in-depth understanding of the markets, the platforms (on which trade is happening), and technical analysis are vital to success**;
