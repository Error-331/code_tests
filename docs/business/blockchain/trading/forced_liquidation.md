# Forced Liquidation

Forced liquidation refers to an involuntary conversion of assets into cash or cash equivalents (such as **stablecoins**). **The term liquidation simply means selling assets for cash**.

- it is a mechanism that creates market orders to exit leveraged positions;
- forced liquidation means that this selling happens automatically, when certain conditions are met;
- in the context of cryptocurrencies, forced liquidation happens when the investor or trader is unable to fulfill the **margin requirements** for a **leveraged position**;
- **the higher the leverage the user use, the closer the liquidation price is to your entry**;
- forced liquidation typically incurs an additional liquidation fee;
- liquidation is also used in the context of bankruptcy procedures, where an entity is forced to convert their assets into **liquid** forms (cash);

Example:

- user starts with $50;
- user enters a **leveraged** long position in the BTC/USDT market with 10x leverage, meaning his position size will be $500;
- this $500 consists of your $50 plus $450 that user has borrowed;
- if the price of Bitcoin goes down 10%, the position is will worth $450;
- if the position incurred further losses, those would apply to the borrowed funds;
- the lender of those funds wonâ€™t risk a loss on the user behalf, so they liquidate his position to protect their capital;
- this means that the position is closed, and the user lost his initial capital of $50;
