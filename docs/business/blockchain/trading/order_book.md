# Order book

The order book is a list of the currently open buy and sell orders for an asset, organized by price.

- the system that matches buy orders with sell orders, called the **matching engine**, uses the order book to execute trades for participants of the exchange;
- blockchain technology has introduced the possibility to create new types of exchanges that algorithmically match buy and sell orders using smart contracts;
- decentralized exchange (DEX) facilitates trades without funds ever being **custodied** by a central entity - albeit with some compromises in performance;
- order books are useful for traders because they help gauge the buyer and seller interest at specific price levels;
- this data can provide valuable information about potential **support** and **resistance** levels;
- **фn imbalance of orders on either the buy or the sell side of the order book may indicate the potential direction of the market**;
- a large number of buy orders around a specific level might indicate a level of **support**;
- a large number of sell orders might indicate an area of **resistance**;
- **these are, of course, not buy or sell signals by themselves**;
- some exchanges, called **dark pools**, have order books that aren’t visible to the public;
