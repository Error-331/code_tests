# Dow Theory

- is a financial framework (for **technical analysis**) modeled on the ideas of Charles Dow;
- Dow helped create the first US stock indices, known as the **Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA)** and **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**;

## Principles

1. _Everything is priced in_ - markets reflect all of the available information on the price of their assets;
2. _Market trends_ - distinguishing between primary, secondary, and tertiary trends;
3. _The phases of a primary trend_ - accumulation, public participation, and excess & distribution;
4. _Cross-index correlation_ - a trend in one index couldn’t be confirmed unless it was observable in another index;
5. _The importance of volume_ - a trend must also be confirmed by high trading volume;
6. _Trends are valid until reversal_ - if a trend is confirmed, it continues until a definite reversal occurs;

## Market trends

- _Primary trend_ - lasting from months to many years, this is the major market movement;
- _Secondary trend_ - lasting from weeks to a few months;
- _Tertiary trend_ - Tends to die in less than a week or not longer than ten days(in some cases, they may last only for a few hours or a day);

### Phases of primary trends

- _Accumulation_ – after the preceding bear market, the valuation of assets is still low as the market sentiment is predominantly negative (smart traders and market makers start 
to accumulate during this period);
- _Public Participation_ - the wider market now realizes the opportunity that smart traders have already observed, and the public becomes increasingly active in buying (during this 
phase, prices tend to increase rapidly);
- _Excess & Distribution_ - the general public continues to speculate, but the trend is nearing its end (The market makers start to distribute their holdings, i.e., by selling to 
other participants who are yet to realize that the trend is about to reverse);

**In a bear market, the phases would essentially be reversed**.
