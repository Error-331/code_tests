# Efficient Market Hypothesis

- is an economic theory stipulating(обусловливать) that the financial markets reflect all available information on the price of assets at any given time;
- it is nearly impossible for investors to gain an edge(получить преимущество) over the market in the long run;
- assets will be valued at their fair price, as all known information will be traded on until it ceases to be useful;
- three levels of available information: **weak**, **semi-strong** and **strong**;

## Weak

- current prices take into account all historical data, and, consequently, that **technical analysis** is irrelevant;
- it omits other kinds of information, and does not reject the notion that methods like **fundamental analysis** or **extensive research** can be used to gain an edge;

## Semi-strong

- all public information has already been factored into the price (news, statements by companies, etc.);
- proponents of this branch believe that even fundamental analysis cannot yield any advantage;
- the only way to gain an advantage over the market is to exploit private information, which is not yet known to the public;

## Strong

- all public and private information is reflected in an asset’s price;
- historical performance, public information and any data available to insiders is also included;
- there is no conceivable way for any market participant to gain an edge with any type of information;
