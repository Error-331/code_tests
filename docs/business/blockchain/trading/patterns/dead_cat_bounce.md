- a brief recovery in the price of a declining asset that is shortly followed by a continuation of the downtrend;
- a **Dead Cat Bounce** may be used as a **technical analysis pattern** for **financial markets** and **cryptocurrency** traders;
- may be included in the group of **continuation patterns**, which means it could be used to forecast the **continuation of previous major price movement**;
- during the initial stages of a Dead Cat Bounce pattern, it might be confused with a **general trend reversal**;
- after some time, the price refuses to go up, and the downward trend continues, breaking previous support levels and creating new lows;
- may also result in what is called a **bull trap**;
