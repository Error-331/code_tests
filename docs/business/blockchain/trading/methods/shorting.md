# Shorting

- selling an asset in the hopes of **rebuying** it later at a lower price;
- short selling stocks or cryptocurrencies is a common strategy for both short-term and long-term traders;

## Principle of operation

- shorting will happen with borrowed funds, though not in all cases;

**Example 1:**

- User put up the required collateral, borrow a specific amount of that asset, and immediately sell it;
- Now, he has an open short position;
- If the market fulfills his expectations and goes lower, he will buy back the same amount that he has borrowed and pay it back to the lender (with interest);
- His profit is the difference between where he initially sold and where he rebought;

**Example 2:**

- User have borrowed **1 BTC** and sell it at **$8,000**;
- Now he has a 1 BTC short position that he will pay interest for;
- The market price of Bitcoin goes down to **$6,000**;
- User buys **1 BTC** and return that **1 BTC** to the lender;
- Profit of the user, in this case, would be **$2,000** (minus the interest payments and fees);

## Risks

- if the stock price increases thanks to some unexpected news, the spike up can quickly "trap" short sellers;
- if the user shorting a borrowed asset and the price increases and keeps going up, he will keep incurring losses;
