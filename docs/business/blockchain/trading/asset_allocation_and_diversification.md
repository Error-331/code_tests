# Asset Allocation and Diversification

- _Asset Allocation_ - a money management strategy that outlines how capital should be distributed between asset classes in an investment portfolio;
- _Diversification_ - the allocation of capital within those **asset classes**;
- the main objective of these strategies is to maximize the expected returns while minimizing the potential risk;
- this involves determining the investor’s **investment time horizon**, **risk tolerance**, and sometimes consideration of the wider **economic conditions**;

## Modern Portfolio Theory

- is a framework that formalizes these principles through a mathematical model;
- if one asset class underperforms, the losses can be balanced out by another asset class that is performing well;
- MPT assumes that by combining assets from uncorrelated asset classes, the **volatility** of the portfolio can be reduced;
- this should also increase the risk-adjusted performance, meaning a portfolio with the same amount of risk will yield better returns;
- it also assumes that if two portfolios offer the same returns, any rational investor will prefer the portfolio with less risk;
- MPT states that it is the most efficient to combine assets in a portfolio that aren’t correlated;

## Types of asset classes and allocation strategies

- **Traditional assets** - stocks, bonds, and cash;
- **Alternative assets** - real estate, commodities, derivatives, insurance products, private equity, and of course, cryptoassets;

### Strategic Asset Allocation

- is considered to be a traditional approach that is more suited to a **passive** investment style;
- portfolios based on it  will tend to be rebalanced only if the desired allocations shift based on a change in the investor’s time horizon or risk profile;

### Tactical Asset Allocation

- is a better fit for more active investment styles;
- allows investors to concentrate their portfolio on assets that are outperforming the market;
- it makes the assumption that if a sector is outperforming the market, it may continue to outperform it for an extended period of time;

### Example

Portfolio should have the following allocations between different asset classes:

- 40% invested in stocks;
- 30% in bonds;
- 20% in cryptoassets;
- 10% in cash;

A diversification strategy may dictate that among the 20% invested in cryptoassets: 

- 70% should be allocated to Bitcoin;
- 15% to large-caps;
- 10% to mid-caps;
- 5% to small-caps;

Once the allocations are established, the performance of the portfolio may be monitored and reviewed regularly.

- if the allocations shift, it may be time to rebalance;
- this generally involves selling top performers and buying underperformers
