## Types of analyzes

### Fundamental analysis (FA)

- is a method for assessing (оценка) a financial asset’s valuation;
- fundamental analyst studies both economic and financial factors to determine if the value of an asset is fair;
- these can include macroeconomic circumstances like the state of the **wider economy**, **industry conditions**, or the **business connected to the asset** (if there’s one);
- may also include an emerging field of data science, such as **on-chain metrics** (_hash rate_, _the top holders_, _the number of addresses_, _analysis of transactions_, etc);
- it's less suitable for cryptocurrencies in their current state;

### Technical analysis (TA)

The core idea behind technical analysis is that historical price action may indicate how the market is likely to behave in the future

- technical analysts don’t try to find out the intrinsic(внутренний) value of an asset;
- analysts look at the historical trading activity and try to identify opportunities based on that;
- TA includes analysis of **price action** and **volume**, **chart patterns**, the use of **technical indicators**, and many other **charting tools**;
- it makes managing trades more defined and measurable;

## General terms

### Drive

- the price of an asset is simply determined by the balance of supply and demand;
- there can be fundamental factors, such as the state of the economy;
- there can be technical factors like the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency;
- there may be other factors to consider, such as market sentiment or recent news;

### Trend

- is the overall direction where the price of an asset is going;
- in technical analysis, market trends are typically identified using price action, **trend lines**, or even key **moving averages**;
- there are two main types of market trends: **bull** and **bear** market;
- a **bull** market consists of a **sustained uptrend**, where prices are continually **going up**;
- a **bear** market consists of a **sustained downtrend**, where prices are continually **going down**;
- a **"sideways"** markets, where there isn’t a clear directional trend;
- a market trend doesn’t mean that the price is always going in the direction of the trend;
- a prolonged bull market will have smaller bear trends contained with it, and vice versa;
- **market trends on higher time frames will always have more significance than market trends on lower time frames**;
- market trends can only be determined with absolute certainty in hindsight (задним числом);
- hindsight (задним числом) bias can have a significant impact on the process of identifying market trends and making trading decisions;

## Cycle

- a cycle is a pattern or trend that emerges at different times;
- **market cycles on higher time frames are more reliable than market cycles on lower time frames**;
- user can eventually find small market cycles on an hourly chart just as you may do when looking at decades of data;
- **markets are cyclical in nature**;
- **it’s almost impossible to determine in any given moment where we currently are in a market cycle**;
- this analysis can be done with high accuracy only after that part of the cycle has concluded;

Example:

- the perpetual futures market is trading higher than the spot market;
- in this case, the funding rate will be positive, meaning that long positions (buyers) pay the funding fees to short positions (sellers);
- this encourages buyers to sell, which then causes the price of the contract to drop, moving it closer to the spot price;
- if the perpetual futures market is trading lower than the spot market, the funding rate will be negative;
- this time, shorts pay longs to incentivize pushing up the price of the contract;
