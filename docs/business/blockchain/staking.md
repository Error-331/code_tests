# Staking

A less resource-intensive alternative to mining. Staking is the act of locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards.

## Principle of operation

- involves validators who lock up their coins so they can be randomly selected by the protocol at specific intervals to create a block;
- participants that stake larger amounts have a higher chance of being chosen as the next block validator;
- staking requires a direct investment in the cryptocurrency itself;
- The **"stake"** (the coin holding) is what incentivizes validators to maintain network security;
- some networks adopt a two-token system where the rewards are paid in a second token;
- enables essentially anyone to perform various network functions in return for staking rewards;

## Rewards calculation

- for some other networks, staking rewards are determined as a fixed percentage;
- these rewards are distributed to validators as a sort of compensation for inflation;
- inflation encourages users to spend their coins instead of holding them, which may increase their usage as  cryptocurrency;

### Factors

1. How many coins the validator is staking?
2. How long the validator has been actively staking?
3. How many coins are staked on the network in total?
4. The inflation rate;
5. Other factors;

## Staking pool

- is a group of coin holders merging their resources to increase their chances of validating blocks and receiving rewards;
- they combine their staking power and share the rewards proportionally to their contributions to the pool;
- many pool providers charge a fee from the staking rewards that are distributed to participants;
- most staking pools require a low minimum balance and append no additional withdrawal times;
- joining a staking pool instead of staking solo might be ideal for newer users;

## Cold staking

- process of staking on a wallet that’s not connected to the Internet;
- networks that support cold staking allow users to stake while securely holding their funds offline;
- if the stakeholder moves their coins out of cold storage, they’ll stop receiving rewards;
- cold staking is particularly useful for large stakeholders who want to ensure maximum protection of their funds while supporting the network;
