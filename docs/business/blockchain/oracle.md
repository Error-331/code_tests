# Oracle

- Blockchain oracles are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information; 
- Blockchain oracles serve as bridges between blockchains and the outside world;
- Blockchains and smart contracts cannot access off-chain data (data that is outside of the network);
- Blockchain oracle is a layer that queries, verifies, and authenticates external data sources and then relays that information;
- To call data from the outside world, the smart contract has to be invoked, and network resources have to be spent;
- Some oracles also have the ability to send data back to external sources;

## Types

Blockchain oracles can be classified depending on a number of different qualities:

- **Source** – does the data originate from software or hardware?
- **Direction of information** – is it inbound or outbound?
- **Trust** – is it centralized or decentralized?
- 
A single oracle can fall into multiple categories. 

### Software oracles

- interact with online sources of information and transmit it to the blockchain. 
- information can come from online databases, servers, websites – essentially, any data source on the Web;

### Hardware oracles

- hardware oracles are designed to get information from the physical world and make it available to smart contracts; 
- information could be relayed from electronic sensors, barcode scanners, and other information reading devices;
- hardware oracle essentially 'translates' real-world events into digital values that can be understood by smart contracts.

### Inbound and outbound oracles

- inbound oracles transmit information from external sources to smart contracts;
- outbound oracles send information from smart contracts to the external world;

### Centralized and decentralized oracles

- a centralized oracle is controlled by a single entity and is the sole provider of information for the smart contract;
- a decentralized oracles share some of the same objectives as public blockchains – avoiding counterparty risk;
- some blockchain projects provide decentralized oracle services to other blockchains;
- decentralized oracles can also be useful in prediction markets, where the validity of a certain outcome can be verified by social consensus;

### Contract-specific oracles

- a contract-specific oracle is one that is designed to be used by a single smart contract;
- this type of oracle is considered very time-consuming and expensive to maintain;

### Human oracles

- sometimes individuals with specialized knowledge in a particular field can also serve as oracles; 
- they can research and verify the authenticity of the information from various sources and translate that information to smart contracts;
