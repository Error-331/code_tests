# Collateral

- is something of value given as a guarantee to obtain something else;
- a borrower may offer their car as a collateral to a lender when taking out a loan;
- the vehicle acts as a safeguard or warranty in case the borrower fails to pay their debts;
- collateralized loans present much lower interest rates when compared to non-collateralized ones;
- some of the most common types include mortgage collaterals, invoice financing, and margin trading collaterals;

## Mortgage / real estate collaterals

- loans that are backed by real state properties;
- the property is the asset (актив) that secures the loan;
- if the borrower fails to make the payments as per the contract, the lender has the right to claim ownership of their real state property;

## Invoice financing

- is a short-term borrowing procedure employed by businesses;
- such a strategy consists of companies using customers’ invoices (that are yet to be paid) as collateral;
- this allows to use funds in advance;

**Example:**

- an online retailer sold $500,000 in products;
- but since most consumers paid by credit card, the company won’t be able to use the money anytime soon;
- the invoice financing strategy would be suitable in this case, allowing the company to improve cash flow, using the money beforehand for high-priority needs;

## Margin trading

- collateral refers to the assets(активы) that are kept in a margin trading account to cover potential losses traders may have when trading on leverage;
- when the user borrows money to trade on margin, his account balance will act as collateral;
- the brokerage (or exchange) reserves the right to liquidate your assets in case the market moves against you;
