# Aave (AAVE)

AAVE is the native governance token of the Aave protocol. Due to Aave being one of the leading decentralized finance protocols, the AAVE token is one of the largest DeFi coins by market cap.

- is an Ethereum-based money market where users can borrow and lend a wide variety of digital assets;
- the Aave protocol is governed by AAVE holders;

## Principle of operation

- allow Ethereum users to obtain cryptocurrency loans or earn a return by lending out their holdings;
- is an algorithmic money market, meaning loans are obtained from a pool instead of being individually matched to a lender;
- the interest rate charged is dependent on the **utilization rate** of the assets in a pool;
- **if nearly all assets in a pool are used, the interest rate is high to entice liquidity providers to deposit more capital**;
- **if nearly no assets in a pool are used, the interest rate charged is low to entice borrowing**;
- allows users to take out loans in a different cryptocurrency than they deposited;
- all loans are **overcollateralized**;
- if the collateral that is provided by the user falls under the collateralization ratio **specified by the protocol**, your collateral may be liquidated;
- a fee is charged in case of **liquidations**;

## Features

- provides flash loans;
- this allows for those without large amounts of capital to **arbitrage** and enact other opportunities - all within a single blockchain transaction;
- Aave is also working on a non-fungible token (NFT) game called **Aavegotchi**;
