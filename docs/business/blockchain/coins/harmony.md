# Harmony (ONE)

Harmony is a layer-1 blockchain using sharding and Effective Proof of Stake to achieve scalability, security, and decentralization. 

- is an Effective Proof of Stake (EPoS) blockchain;
- it claims to solve the blockchain trilemma of **decentralization**, **scalability**, and **security**;
- the blockchain offers **bridging** services between BNB Smart Chain (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and other networks;

## Sharding

- sharding splits the network into **four** sections that work in parallel;
- users can choose the shard they want, which distributes the network's workload;
- validation, transactions, block creation, and staking are all done separately on each shard;
- a validator doesn't need to maintain a full copy of the entire blockchain's transaction history;
- validators are randomly assigned to shards to prevent hostile shard takeovers;
- after every Epoch, validators will likely move to a new shard, and leaders rotate;

## Effective Proof of Stake

- **validators** stake ONE (Harmony's native token) to run a node and possibly process transactions through an election process;
- **delegators** stake their ONE behind a validator in return for a percentage of future block rewards and transaction fees;
- once elected and assigned a shard, the **validator** creates blocks and shares its rewards with **delegators**;
- EPoS reduces rewards and **penalizes** validators who stake **too much** in a single node;
- nodes with smaller stakes actually receive more favorable rewards in relation to their size, encouraging large validators to decentralize;
- **EPoS provides low gas fees**;

## ONE

- the Harmony protocol's native token;
- used for paying network transaction fees;
- used for staking as a delegator or validator in return for block rewards;
- used for taking part in Harmony's open governance mechanism;
- transaction fees are burned with an end goal of creating a net-zero state, offsetting the ONE provided for block rewards;
