# Which network to use to store USDT

USDT can be stored on multiple networks. User must match the network on both the sending and receiving ends. User should choose the network based on fees, speed, and 
compatibility with your wallet and the platform you're interacting with.

- the most popular being Tron (TRC-20) for low fees; 
- Ethereum (ERC-20) for broad compatibility and security; 
- BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20) for cheap, fast transactions within the BNB ecosystem;
- 
## Popular Networks

- TRC-20 (Tron) - cheapest and fastest, great for high-volume transactions;
- ERC-20 (Ethereum) - secure, battle-tested network, though with higher fees;
- BEP-20 (BNB Smart Chain) - offers low fees and strong integration with Binance and DeFi;
- Solana (SOL) - ultra-fast confirmation and low costs, popular for real-time commerce;
- TON (The Open Network) - Gaining traction due to Telegram's ecosystem;

## How to Choose a Network

1. Check Wallet & Exchange Support: Ensure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger) and the exchange support the USDT version (ERC-20, TRC-20, etc.);
2. Match Sender & Receiver: The network must be identical for both the sender and the recipient to avoid losing funds;
3. Consider Fees & Speed: TRC-20 and BEP-20 are usually cheaper, ERC-20 is more secure but costly, Solana is very fast;
4. Key Takeaway: Always confirm the network (e.g., TRC-20, ERC-20) on both your wallet's deposit/withdrawal screen and the platform you're sending to before initiating a transfer;
