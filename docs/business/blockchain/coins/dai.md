# MakerDAO (DAI)

MakerDAO is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) project with a crypto-collateralized, stablecoin DAI pegged to the US dollar.

- famous crypto-backed stablecoins that tracks USD on Ethereum;
- the coin is managed by the **MakerDAO community** that holds the governance token **MKR**;
- user can use MKR to create and vote on proposals to change the project;
- DAI is over-collateralized to deal with the volatility of crypto, and users enter into Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) that manage their collateral;
- the whole process is run via smart contracts;
- **user can also use DAI as leverage and invest it in the DAI Savings Rate contract for interest**;

## Principle of operation

- its community manages the coin via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO); 
- users generate DAI by locking cryptocurrency in a **Maker Vault** at a certain Liquidation Ratio;
- the stablecoin is **overcollateralized** to account for crypto's volatile prices, and a Stability Fee is also charged;
- user's crypto is liquidated and used to recover any losses if user's collateral drops below the Liquidation Ratio;
- DAI remains stable as its DAO controls the Stability Fee and Dai Savings Rate; 
- the Stability Fee affects DAI's supply by changing the cost of minting DAI; 
- the DAI Savings Rate affects the coin's demand, changing investors' returns on staking DAI; 
- when DAI moves from its peg, the DAO uses these two mechanisms to bring it back;

Example: a 125% Liquidation Ratio requires $1.25 of crypto collateral value for each $1 of DAI.
