# Polkadot (DOT)

Next-generation blockchain protocol, capable of connecting multiple specialized chains into one universal network.

## Principle of operation

- open-source protocol built for everyone;
- focuses on security, scalability, and innovation;
- an individual blockchain in the Polkadot ecosystem is called a **parachain** (parallel blockchain);
- the main chain is called the **Relay Chain**;
- **parachains** and the **Relay Chain** can easily exchange information at all times;
- parachains are similar to individual shards in the planned implementation of **ETH 2.0**;
- any developer, company, or individual can spin up their custom parachain through **Substrate** (framework for creating cryptocurrencies and decentralized systems);
- once the custom chain is connected to the Polkadot network, it becomes interoperable with all other parachains on the network;
- securing and validating the data across the different parachains is done through **network validators**, where a small set of these validators can secure multiple **parachains**;
- these validators will also ensure transactions can be spread across multiple **parachains** to improve scalability;
- chains that aren’t useful or projects that are no longer maintained will be removed, and their **bonded tokens** returned;

## Advantages

- acts as a multichain network, allowing it to process transfers in parallel across different individual chains;
- parallel processing;
- allows every individual chain to have its design optimized for that specific functionality;
- with the help of **Substrate**, developers can efficiently adapt their individual chains to suit the needs of the project;
- gives possibility to create an entirely new financial ecosystem, with every individual parachain taking care of one particular aspect at a time;
- any community associated with a specific **parachain** will be able to govern their network as they see fit;
- makes it very easy to upgrade individual **parachains**. (no need for hard forks);

## DOT token

- grants token holders with governance rights of the entire Polkadot platform;
- includes determining network fees, voting on overall network upgrades, and the deployment or removal of parachains;
- DOT is also designed to facilitate network consensus through staking;

### Bonding

- this is required when new parachains are added to the Polkadot ecosystem;
- during a bonding period, the bonded DOT is locked;
- it’s released once the bond duration has ended and the parachain is removed from the ecosystem;

## Staking

- known as **Proof of Stake (PoS)**, this consensus model works by rewarding users for staking coins on the network; 
- with Polkadot, honest stakers are rewarded, while bad actors can lose their entire stake;
