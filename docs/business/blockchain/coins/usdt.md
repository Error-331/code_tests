## Principle of operation

- As a stablecoin, Tether’s appeal is in its tethering(привязанность) or pegging(привязка) to fiat currency; 
- USDT was said to have been originally pegged exactly to USD, with $1 USD held for every USDT in circulation;
- It has morphed(трансформировался) to include holding collateral(включать залоговое обеспечение) with other real-world cash equivalents, assets, and receivables from loans;

- Available on different blockchains;
- Different use cases as compared to traditional cryptocurrencies;

## Use cases

- Quick access to market stability;

- Easily move funds between exchanges;
- It is able to move funds between exchanges very quickly; 
- This can also be useful for arbitrage trading with other coins;

### Trade on crypto-only exchanges

- Some exchanges do not have facilities for fiat deposit and withdrawal but do allow USDT trading; 
- By obtaining Tether first, user will be able to trade on these exchanges without worrying about the market volatility of placing your main trading funds in BTC (or other cryptos);

### Forex-style trading

- Since USDT is pegged to the USD, user can do Forex-style trading by exchanging local (non-US) currencies into USDT when their value is high against the USD; 
- User can then cash out to local currencies when the local currency drops or exchange for other assets;

## Storing Tether (USDT)

- Apart from Binance and other cryptocurrency exchanges, you can store your USDT on various **crypto wallets**; 
- These include web and mobile wallets (like **Trust Wallet**), or cold storage hardware wallets (such as **Ledger**) through third-party software wallets;
- As USDT is issued on a range of different blockchains, **user need to ensure that you are transferring it from and to the same network**;

### Example

If the user go to the Binance USDT withdrawal page, he will find five different network options to transfer to: 

1. Binance Chain (BEP2);
2. Binance Smart Chain (BEP20);
3. Ethereum (ERC20);
4. Tether (OMNI);
5. Tron (TRC20);

If the user use the wrong network you might lose your funds. For instance, if the user tries to send **Omni USDT** to an **ERC-20 USDT** address, transfer will most likely be lost;
Aas of December 2020, the ERC-20 USDT is the only type supported by **Ledger**. **This means that the USDT running on the Bitcoin blockchain (Omni Layer) is not available to transfer 
to the Ledger hardware wallets.**
