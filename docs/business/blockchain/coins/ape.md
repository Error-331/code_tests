## The APE Coin Protocol

### Incentivization (Стимулирование)

APE is to serve as a tool for developers to take part in the ecosystem by incorporating it in their products, games, services, and so forth;

### Governance (Управление)

Governance is one of the main purposes behind APE as it allows holders to participate in the DAO.

### Access (Доступ)

The cryptocurrency provides access to some parts of the ecosystem which are otherwise unavailable. These would include merch, events, games, and so forth – exclusive to holders.
Being the utility token of the ecosystem, APE also gives its participants a currency that can be used without any centralized intermediaries.
