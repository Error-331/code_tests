## Principle of operation

- mechanism keeps the supply and reserves at a constant 1:1 ratio;

- whenever the price of BUSD begins to move lower than $1 per 1 BUSD, arbitrager traders will purchase BUSD in large quantities;
- even a price of $0.98 could provide them an opportunity to make a profit; 
- after purchasing large amounts of BUSD, the arbitragers can then convert the BUSD tokens into fiat through the Paxos platform; 
- an increase in demand for BUSD naturally raises the token price back up to $1, restoring the 1:1 peg;
