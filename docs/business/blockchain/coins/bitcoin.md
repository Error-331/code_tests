## Omni Layer

Omni Layer is an open source, decentralized asset infrastructure built on Bitcoin. It is the successor of the work produced by the **Mastercoin Foundation** with the funding from its ICO 
in 2013. 

- Omni Layer is an ongoing project, with its reference implementation known as **Omni Core**;
- Omni Core essentially enhances elements of Bitcoin with additional features;
- Omni Core provides smart contract capabilities, enabling developers to automate currency functions in a decentralized and transparent way;

## Principle of operation

By building a second-layer protocol on top of Bitcoin, Omni benefited from the large network effect Bitcoin already had.

- _Custom currencies_ - anyone can create currencies where the ledger is managed by the Omni Layer network;
- _Decentralized exchange_ - instead of using a centralized exchange to facilitate the exchange of two currencies between parties, the Omni Layer code executes this trade;
- _Adding custom logic_ - **bitcoin** added the _OP_RETURN_ field, which enables the attachment of additional data to a bitcoin transaction;

## Limitations of Omni Core (in terms of development)

- blockchain scaling and speed depended on Bitcoin and its core developers;
- **Omni Core** still has limited influence over the future of the blockchain it runs on;
- the **Bitcoin** blockchain is not designed for program execution;
- this blockchain optimized for store of value, and its limited scripting language means that it will never be suitable for sophisticated smart contracts built directly on top of it;
