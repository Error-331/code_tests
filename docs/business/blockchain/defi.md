## Ways to earn money

### Liquidity Needs

- the user is a long-term holder of BTC and ETH and he have most of his net worth in crypto while holding very few fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar to pay for day-to-day expenses; 
- an unforeseen event like a car accident happens and he needs a great amount of USD to repair his car or buy a new one;
- he could sell $20,000 worth of BTC to satisfy his liquidity needs and buy it back after a year; 
- however, if BTC appreciates(ценит) in value by 30% in that year, I would incur a 30% loss;
- instead of selling, he can use his BTC as collateral and borrow the amount of USD he needs while paying a 5% annual fee; 
- this way, he can be exposed to BTC capital appreciation while still having the liquidity he needs to pay the unforeseen expense;

### Investment Leverage

- user holds **$20,000** worth of **BTC**; 
- if Bitcoin appreciates by 30% in one year, he earns **$6,000**; 
- however, if he uses **$20,000** BTC as collateral to borrow **$10,000** USDC, he can then use that to buy another **$10,000** worth of BTC; 
- if Bitcoin appreciates by 30% in one year, he earns **$9,000** and, after paying **$500** worth of interest, he will have a net gain of **$8,500** instead of just **$6,000**; 
- this is the same concept of using leverage as he would see in traditional finance;
- however, instead of getting the leverage via a **broker**, he gets it via a decentralized liquidity protocol;
