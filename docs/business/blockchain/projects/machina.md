# Machina

Sharded data storage structure that is designed to provide scalable, cost-efficient, and immediately retrievable information on-chain. Machina leverages the unique properties of 
**Nightshade** sharding of **NEAR** and provides a seamless economic model utilizing stablecoins.

- reliable way to store, transmit, and exchange data in immutable environment and freely accessible, and/or readable;
- it can scale up the data stored proportionally to the number of validators joining the network;
- use PoS consensus;
- energy-efficient and computationally less burdening consensus;
- unlike PoW, doesn't require a potential validator to possess a powerful machine in order to produce blocks;
- use file-based storage, storing every transaction directly into it, removing the runtime needed to actuate the retrieval or uploading period;
- on-chain data to be accessible on-chain coupled with all of the security measures;
- will aid in ushering a new way of smart contract development that will allow a far wider scope of possibilities to innovate in;
- will not use smart contracts (no need for gas);
