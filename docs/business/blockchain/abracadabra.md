# Abracadabra (DeFi)

- is a multi-chain, DeFi project that allows users to stake their interest-bearing tokens (ibTKNs), from other popular DeFi platforms, as collateral;
- users gain interest-bearing tokens when they deposit their funds in a lending pool or yield optimizer; 
- holding the token gives you access to your original deposit plus the interest earned;
- user can further unlock the value of your interest-bearing tokens by using them as collateral for a Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin loan;

## Terms

- users -> Spellcasters;
- MIM token has a US Dollar peg and is transferable for many popular **stablecoins**;
- the native **SPELL token** offers holders governance rights and the chance to earn a passive income through staking with the platform;
- spellcasters receive sSPELL tokens granting utility and earnings from the protocol;

## List of interest bearing tokes

1. yvWETH — WETH v2 Yearn Vault;
2. yvUSDC — USDC v2 Yearn Vault;
3. yvYFI — YFI v2 Yearn Vault;
4. yvUSDT — USDT v2 Yearn Vault;
5. xSUSHI — staked SUSHI;

## Principle of operation

- Spellcasters can deposit their interest-bearing token (ibTKN) as collateral and take out Magic Internet Money (MIM) loans;
- Spellcasters can use the MIM tokens as they please;
- As the MIM tokens are fully collateralized with tokens bearing interest on other platforms, theoretically, the collateral of the loan should continually increase;

## Example

- a user deposits 100,000 USDT in the **Yearn Finance USDT V2 yVault** (making his assets work for him by earning a passive income);
- a user receives **yvUSDT** tokens in return (representing the value of his stake in the vault);
- as user earns rewards through **Yearn Finance**, the value of his **yvUSDT** tokens increases accordingly;
- a few days later a user wants to buy a car and decides to enter the **Abracadabra Money spell** book and deposits his **yvUSDT** tokens before choosing the collateralization ratio;
- user takes out the largest loan he can (90%) and receives 90,000 Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin tokens;
- a user confirms the price and preferred medium of exchange; 
- the car dealership state it will accept 30,000 USDT for the car;
- a user then returns to Abracadabra Money to swap his MIM tokens for USDT through the **Curve MIM-3Pool Metapool**;
- within a few minutes, a user sends 30,000 USDT to the car dealership. 
- a user buys the car, knowing his **yvUSDT** is increasing in value while he’s cruising along;

## Tokens

### SPELL Token

- The native SPELL token is an ERC-20 token with an initial maximum supply of 420 billion tokens (cut to 210 billion by **Magical Burn** spell); H
- The distribution of SPELL tokens is primarily weighted towards the **MIM-3LP3CRV LP** tokens (45%) and an allocation for the Abracadabra Money team (30%); 
- For the SushiSwap **ETH-SPELL LP** tokens, Abracadabra Money reserves 18% of the SPELL token supply; 
- The remaining 7% was allocated to the initial DEX offering (IDO);
- The main role of the SPELL token is to provide governance of the platform (at the time of writing);
- SPELL token holders can vote on proposals and updates to help improve the platform and user experience (UX); 
- SPELL token holders can also make a passive income by staking their assets;
- Holders can earn a percentage of platform fees in return for supporting the platform;
- To activate governance rights and access rewards, SPELL token holders must stake their tokens to obtain sSPELL tokens; 
- The magic surrounding sSPELL tokens is largely still "locked in the spell book";

### sSPELL Token

- Accessing the full utility of the SPELL token requires first **staking** the token in the Abracadabra Money protocol;
- Users then receive sSPELL tokens in return;
- sSPELL tokens will automatically replace and represent the SPELL token value in users’ wallets;
- sSPELL tokens grant Spellcasters the right to vote on adjustments to certain protocol parameters;
- This could include **liquidation** fees or future collateral options;
- sSPELL token holders automatically receive compounding interest on their stake;
- sSPELL tokens and the SPELL token are redeemable 1:1.
- Spellcaster can reverse the staking spell - he will receive their initial SPELL token deposit plus any further SPELL tokens accrued over time through fees;

### Magic Internet Money (MIM) Token

- The Magic Internet Money (MIM) token is a stablecoin and the crux of the operations of the Abracadabra Money platform; 
- With a peg to the US Dollar, the protocol mints new MIM tokens upon confirmation of **collateralization**;
- Upon launching the Abracadabra Money protocol, the sole income stream is from the interest payments of Magic Internet Money (MIM) token loans; 
- In turn, 75% of these funds go towards purchasing SPELL tokens to award to sSPELL token holders; 
- A further 20% goes to the governance treasury, using fees to incentivize MIM liquidity pools; 
- Finally, 5% of platform fees automatically redirects to a multisig treasury managing a contingency fund; 
- The treasury funds will only be used on such an occasion when "market conditions permit intervention" to minimize or prevent any losses to Spellcasters or Abracadabra Money;

#### Where to buy

- Uniswap; 
- SushiSwap;
- Curve Finance;

## Spell book

### Borrow (Summoning MIMs)

- This spell generates the option to provide interest-bearing token (ibTKN) collateral and borrow Magic Internet Money (MIM) tokens
- When entering the “Borrow” page of the spell book, there is a grid displaying a list of different “components” or ibTKN collateral tokens. 
- Also, the page views the number of MIM tokens already borrowed, and the number of MIM tokens left available.
- Furthermore, the display shows the interest rate and how much the Magic Internet Money (MIM) token debt will increase annually.
- A liquidation fee is in place as an additional amount of funds that will be lost in the unlikely event of liquidation.
- a colorful “safe indicator” warns Spellcasters if the collateral to loan ratio is over risky, next to the component liquidation price setting.

### Stake

- The “Stake” page of the platform enables SPELL token holders to stake their tokens to receive sSPELL tokens in return.
- SPELL tokens are subject to a 24-hour lock-up period
- sSPELL token holders can watch their staked funds grow, earning fees from Magic Internet Money (MIM) token loan repayments. 
- Further, the interest is compounding, helping Spellcasters earn more yield faster.

### Farm (The Polymorph Spell)

- the Polymorph Spell is a ritual spell that allows Spellcasters to summon more SPELL tokens;
- users can add **liquidity** to the **Curver Finance** Magic Internet Money (MIM) pool, receiving **crvMIM3POOL** tokens;
- holders can then use these **crvMIM3POOL** tokens on the “Farm” page of the Abracadabra Money spell book;
- users are still earning yield on their interest-bearing tokens (ibTKNs) on other respective platforms  (e.g., Yearn Finance);
- crvMIM3POOL tokens accrue interest from trading fees on **Curve**;
- users can also earn a yield on these tokens too, earning the platform’s SPELL token;

### Bridge

- the **Bridge** is available for users to transfer assets between different blockchains;
- this includes Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Avalanche, and Fantom;
- the average time for a cross-chain transaction is between 10 and 30 minutes;

### Swap

- that automatically redirects Spellcasters to the Curve Finance website to swap any Magic Internet Money (MIM) tokens;
- **Spellcasters** can choose to swap MIM tokens for USDC, USDT, or DAI;

## Risks

- liquidation is always possible;
- if the value of the collateral falls below a specified point (usually when the collateral isn’t enough to cover the debt) will the liquidation of assets occur;
- smart contracts (dApps) can still fall vulnerable to exploits and bugs within the code;

### Examples

- The liquidation limit is on display when Spellcasters open up debt positions on the Abracadabra Money platform;
- As the collateral for Magic Internet Money (MIM) tokens is through interest-bearing tokens (**ibTKNs**), the collateral ratio should continuously increase;
- However, if Spellcasters use **ibTKNs** representing volatile assets (SUSHI, YFI, and ETH), assets may fall below liquidation levels in the unlikely case of a **black swan** event;

## Strategies

- one strategy would be to deposit **stablecoins** in a yield-farming smart contract and then use the interest-bearing tokens to generate MIM;
- as long as your **stablecoins** don’t experience volatility, the chances of liquidation will remain low;

## Important notes

Taking loan from **Abracadabra** can be used as hedge against volatility on **Ethereum**. User can use this **stablecoins** (MIM) to yield farm on different protocol and then return 
them based on the price action of the asset.
