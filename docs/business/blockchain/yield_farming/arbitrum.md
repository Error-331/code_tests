# Arbitrum

- the company behind Arbitrum is Offchain Labs;
- a number of the top decentralized finance (DeFi), such as Aave, Balancer, Band Protocol, Curve, Sushiswap and Uniswap are already leveraging or looking to use Arbitrum to increase
throughput and lower fees for their users;
- future versions of Arbitrum will also have two other modes: **channels** and **AnyTrust sidechains**;

## Overall

- is a layer 2 solution designed to improve the capabilities of **Ethereum** smart contracts;
- boosting **Ethereum** smart contracts speed and scalability;
- wadding in additional privacy features to boot for **Ethereum** smart contracts;
- platform is designed to allow developers to easily run unmodified **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** contracts and **Ethereum transactions** on a second layer, while still benefiting 
from Ethereum's excellent layer 1 security;
- address the issue with poor efficiency and high execution costs of **Ethereum** smart contracts;
- uses a technique known as **transaction rollups** to record batches of submitted transactions on the **Ethereum** main chain, and execute them on a cheap, scalable layer 2 sidechain 
while leveraging Ethereum to ensure correct results; 
- helps to offload most of the computational and storage burden **Ethereum** currently suffers from, while enabling new classes of powerful layer 2-based **DApps**;

## Principle of operation

- is a type of technology known as an **optimistic rollup**;
- it allows Ethereum smart contracts to scale by passing messages between smart contracts on the Ethereum main chain and those on the Arbitrum **second layer** chain;
- much of the transaction processing is completed on the second layer and the results of this are recorded on the main chain;
- it’s optimistic in the sense that any validator is able to post a rollup block and confirm the validity of other blocks;
- the term rollup is used to describe how public information can be used to reconstruct a complete history of the chain from an optimized log of events;
- the **Arbitrum** protocol ensures that code will run correctly so long as any **validator is honest**, helping the network resist collusion and other forms of attack;
- individual nodes can choose to participate in the Arbitrum chain;
- **validator nodes** are involved in observing the state of the chain, and full nodes help to aggregate layer 1 transactions;
- **aggregators** that submit transactions to the layer 1 chain earn rewards paid in **ETH**, while the rest of the user transaction fees are distributed to other network
participants (such as **validators**);
- Arbitrum introduces a challenge step for rollup blocks, which sees other validators check the correctness of a block and issue a challenge if they believe it is wrong;
- if the block is proven to be incorrect or a challenge is proven unjustified, the lying validator will have their stake confiscated, ensuring validators always play fair;
- the platform also has its own custom virtual machine - Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM);
- AVM exists above the **EthBridge** - the set of smart contracts that interfaces with the **Arbitrum chain**;
- **Ethereum**-compatible smart contracts are automatically translated to run on the AVM;

## Key features

Easy-to-use platform developers can use to launch highly efficient and scalable Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.

### High EVM compatibility

- Arbitrum is considered to be one of the most EVM-compatible rollups;
- compatible with the EVM at the **bytecode** level;
- any language that can compile to EVM works out of the box - such as **Solidity** and **Vyper**;

### Robust developer tooling

- minimize barriers to entry when it comes to building on their layer 2 solution;
- produced comprehensive developer documentation for Arbitrum;
- no need to download anything specific to Arbitrum, such as plugins, or compilers like **Hardhat** or **Truffle**;

### Low fees

- boosts Ethereum’s transactional throughput;
- minimizes transaction fees;
- extremely efficient rollup technology;
- Arbitrum is able to cut fees down to just a tiny fraction of what they are on **Ethereum**;

### Fairly launched

- currently live on mainnet for developers;
- Arbitrum doesn't have its own native utility token — hence there was no token sale;
