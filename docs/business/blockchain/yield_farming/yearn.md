# Yearn (YFI)

- YFI is the native cryptocurrency of the Yearn.finance protocol;
- It is a governance token that allows users to vote on which direction they want the protocol to head;
- YFI has become one of the largest Ethereum-based tokens due to the protocol's focus on automated yield farming strategies;
- YFI is like a robot that always tries to find the best yields in Ethereum DeFi;
- YFI provides its users with access to the highest yields on deposits of ether, stablecoins, and altcoins;

## Key features

- Vaults - main feature of the protocol, it allows users to deposit cryptocurrency and earn yields;
- The deposited funds are managed by a strategy that attempts to maximize yields and minimize risk; 
- Vaults are focused on stablecoins, tokenized Bitcoin products, Chainlink, and other coins;
- Vaults mitigate the high cost of transacting on Ethereum, by pooling capital; 
- Only one account (the controller of each Vault) has to pay transaction fees (gas) to yield farm;

### Farming methods

- providing liquidity to Balancer (decentralized exchange); 
- depositing capital into Yearn.finance's products;

## Decentralizing Yearn.finance

- YFI coin also had another purpose: to decentralize development and control of the protocol amongst users;
- The farming mechanism allowed any user – whether they had $100 or $1,000,000 – to earn YFI at the same time and at the same cost;
- A comprehensive governance portal has launched where token holders can vote on various decisions proposed by community members;
- Decisions that have been made thus far include the hiring of a team of marketers and developers and the addition of certain strategies to Vaults;
- Holders have also made the crucial decision to provide YFI holders with access to a portion of the protocol profits;
- Fees implemented within Yearn.finance products accrue to the Treasury, which is subsequently distributed between YFI holders and the team; 
- This makes YFI a *dividend-yielding asset*, which is different from Bitcoin or Ethereum;

## Advantages

- YFI users had to participate in the protocol (instead of just buy coins); 
- every user had the same ability to influence Yearn.finance through the governance token;
- Yearn.finance has one of the most active communities in the decentralized finance space and cryptocurrencies as a whole;

## Challenges

- This was accentuated earlier this year when it was reported that Cronje said he wanted to leave the DeFi space; 
- YFI prices proceeded to crumble amid fears of the project shutting down;
