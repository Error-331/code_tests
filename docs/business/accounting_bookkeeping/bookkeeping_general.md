| Coca-Cola  |	7		  | -2.4	  |	-7.4      |

## Event recording

Bookkeeping - the preservation of a systematic, quantitative record of an activity. Events that cannot be reliably measured in **monetary** terms will not be reflected in the 
**financial statements**.

### Annual Report

- Competitive environment;
- Product development;
- Marketing and sales efforts;

Accounting Information = Monetary transactions;

Examples:

_Complex transaction_

- Company buys a building ($20.000 in cash);
- Company will pay $10.000 per year for 10 years;
- Company pay $2.000 in property tax from last year (associated with this building);
- Company also gives the former owner 500 shares of stock;
- Building requires $23.000 in repairs before it can be used;

_Multiple transactions_

1. Owners invest $50.000 (first transaction);
   - Assets = $50.000(Cash);
   - Equity = $50.000(Capital stock);

2. Borrow $25.000 from Bank (second transaction)
   - Assets = $25.000(Cash);
   - Liability = $25.000 (Notes payable);

3. Inventory Purchased on Credit (third transaction);
   - Assets = $14.000(Inventory);
   - Liability = $14.000(Accounts payable);

4. Purchase Equipment with Cash;
   - Assets = $15.000(Equipment) - $15.000(Cash);

|                                  | Assets           | = | Liabilities + Equity |
|:--------------------------------:|:----------------:|---|:--------------------:|
|                                  | $0.00            |   | $0.00                |
| 1. Owners invest                 | +50.000          |   | +50.000              |
|                                  | $50.000          | = | $50.000              |
| 2. Borrow $25.000 from bank      | +25.000          |   | +25.000              |
|                                  | $75.000          | = | $75.000              |
| 3. Inventory purchased on credit | +14.000          |   | +14.000              |
|                                  | $89.000          | = | $89.000              |
| 4. Purchase equipment with cash  | +15.000 - 15.000 |   | 0                    |
|                                  | $89.000	      | = | $89.000              |

Assets = $89.00;
Liabilities = $39.000;
Owners Equity = $50.000;

### Using accounts to categorize transactions

Account - Specific accounting record that provides an efficient way to categorize similar transactions.

Example:

_Multiple transactions_

|                   |         | Assets    |           |   | Liabilities      |               |   | Equity        |
|-------------------|:-------:|:---------:|:---------:|---|:----------------:|:-------------:|---|--------------:|
| Transaction #     | Cash    | Inventory | Equipment | = | Accounts Payable | Notes Payable | + | Capital Stock |
| Beginning balance | $0      | $0        | $0        | = | $0               | $0            | + | 0             |
| 1                 | +50.000 |           |           |   |                  |               |   | +50.000       |
| Subtotal          | $50.000 | $0        | $0        | = |                  |               | + | $50.000       |
| 2                 | +25.000 |           |           |   |                  | +25.000       |   |               |
| Subtotal          | $75.000 | $0        | $0        | = |                  | $25.000       | + | $50.000       |
| 3                 |         | +14.000   |           |   | +14.000          |               |   |               |
| Subtotal          | $75.000 | $14.000   | $0        | = | $14.000          |               | + |               |
| 4                 | -15.000 |           | +15.000   |   |                  |               |   |               |
| Total             | $60.000 | $14.000   | $15.000   | = | $14.000          | $25.000       | + | $50.000       |

#### T Account

T Account - Debit and Credit

Example:

_Cash_

| Cash  |        |
|:-----:|:------:|
| Debit | Credit |

Debit (DR, associated with minus) - left;
Credit (CR, associated with plus) - right;

- Asset accounts will usually have debit balances;
- Liabilities and owner's equity accounts will typically have credit balances;

Debits = Credits;

- Debits on the left, credits on the right;
- At least one debit and one credit;
- Debits must always equal credits;

_Test_:

**Question**: after an owner gives ABC $10,000 cash, making a +$10,000 entry under Equity and a -$10,000 entry under Assets (Wrong);  
**Answer**: this would make the accounting equation out of balance. Both Assets and Equity should be entered as +$10,000;  

**Question**: after borrowing $10,000 from a bank, making a +$10,000 entry under Assets and a +$10,000 under Equity (Wrong);  
**Answer**: while this will balance, a loan is a liability that must be repaid, not an increase in equity;
