# Investing tips

## Partnerships of the team (behind NFT)

- verify accomplishments and credibility of the team;
- research deeply and find out whether or not the team has merit behind it;

## Community

- check if team is in partnerships with other companies or with some well-known and well-received developers with proven track records;
- a community that’s doing its best to represent the collection and, even more – to push it further is something that should be on a look for;
- NFT community is primarily in **Discord** - there are many projects who tend to use bots to artificially inflate the community and make it appear as a vibrant one;
- a proper community attempts to add value instead of asking the blatant questions – _wen mint? Wen moon?_

## Roadmap

- good projects tend to have considerate roadmaps;
- need to be on a look out for how achievable the roadmap is;
- good projects grow steadily, and they do not rush deliveries - they prefer **quality over quantity**;

## Artwork

- it needs to be recognizable, albeit a derivative;

## Website

- it needs to show that the team put some thought in it and didn’t just blast it in a couple of hours to pull off yet another cash grab;

## Meme Culture

- don’t fade meme culture;
- the term **let’s ape in** a certain cryptocurrency became hot during the DeFi summer in 2020;

## Exclusivity

- as time goes by, **Bluechip** NFT collections will be those that had been well-funded from the get-go, making the barrier to success a lot higher;

## Influencers and Celebrities

- user needs to be very selective and make sure to carefully see what influencers and celebrities stand behind the project (if any); 
- their reputation is what should be considering here;

## Volume and Price

- **Bluechip** projects tend to perform better than others in terms of both volume and price after they hit the open market;
- user needs to actually find a buyer for your particular NFT –  usr can’t just hit the “sell” button and liquidate it (unlike trading cryptocurrencies);
- this means that projects that have good liquidity should be preferred to those that don’t for this exact reason;
- getting into a collection with steadily declining volume means that user risks failing in selling his NFTs and being stuck with them until a buyer pops up;

## Holders Diversification

- transparent NFT marketplaces gives opportunity to instantly verify if the supply of a certain collection is **highly concentrated** or **diversified**;
- in general, user would expect for a good project to be backed by a large number of holders; 
- there’s a caveat that one person can create multiple ETH addresses and hold more NFTs;
- regardless of this - **a decent number of holders, making the entire series less centralized**;

## Utility and Copyright

- utility is what might yield longer-term benefit (BAYC holders have so far been massively rewarded by the team who created two additional collections and airdropped them to current 
holders or allowed them to mint exclusively, thus bringing added value);
- check if a holder, are entitled to something else besides a verifiably non-fungible JPEG;
- every NFT collection decides what to allow and restrict when it comes to copyright (there are collections that restrict owners to do certain things with their NFTs or 
are maybe under some sort of a royalty agreement);
