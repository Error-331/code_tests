# Gross Sales

**Gross sales** are the **total sales** recorded prior to **sales discounts** and **sales returns**. It is useful as a measure of the overall sales activity of a business. However, 
if a company is selling faulty products that are later **returned**, gross sales is **not a good indicator** of the abilities of an entity (net sales is a better indicator).

Investors commonly track gross sales to see if a business is generating sales at a **faster** or **slower** pace than its competitors. This can be used as an indicator of whether a 
company's product niche is **maturing**, which in turn can indicate changes in the value of an organization.
