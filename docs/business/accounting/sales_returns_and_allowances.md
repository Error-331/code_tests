# Sales Returns and Allowances

Sales returns and allowances is a **deduction** from **sales** that shows the sale price of goods returned by customers, as well as discounts taken by them to retain 
**defective goods**. When this amount is large in proportion to total sales, it indicates that a business is having trouble shipping high-quality goods to its customers.

## Accounting for Sales Returns and Allowances

This **line item** is the **aggregation** of two general ledger accounts, which are the **sales returns** account and the **sales allowances** account. Both of these accounts 
are **contra accounts**, which means that they offset gross sales. The natural balance in these accounts is a **debit**, which is the reverse of the natural credit balance in 
the gross sales account.

## Presentation of Sales Returns and Allowances

Sales returns and allowances is a line item appearing in the income statement. This line item is presented as a subtraction from the **gross sales line item**, and is intended 
to reduce sales by the amount of **product returns** from customers and sales allowances granted. It is followed in the income statement by a **net sales line item**, which is 
a calculation that adds together the gross sales line item and the negative amount in the sales returns and allowances line item.
