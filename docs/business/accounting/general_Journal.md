# General journal

The general journal is part of the accounting record keeping system. When an event occurs that must be recorded, it is called a **transaction**, and may be recorded in a 
**specialty journal** or in the **general journal**. There are **four** specialty journals, which are so named because specific types of routine transactions are recorded 
in them. These journals are the **sales journal**, **cash receipts journal**, **purchases journal**, and **cash disbursements journal**. There could be more specialty journals,
but the four accounting areas represented by these journals contain the bulk of all accounting transactions, so there is usually no need for additional journals. Instead, 
by default, all remaining transactions are recorded in the general journal. Once entered, the general journal provides a chronological record of all **non-specialized** entries 
that would otherwise have been recorded in one of the specialty journals.

Example: asset sales, depreciation, interest income and interest expense, and stock sales.

## Journal entry format

**Transactions** are recorded in all of the various journals in a **debit and credit** format, and are recorded in order by date, with the earliest entries being recorded first.
These entries are called **journal entries**. Each journal entry includes the date, the amount of the debit and credit, the titles of the accounts being debited and credited 
(with the title of the credited account being indented), and also a short narration of why the journal entry is being recorded.

Example:

| Date     | Account                                           |   Debit |  Credit | 
|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------|--------:|--------:|
| June 30  | Depreciation expense                              |  10,000 |         |
|          | Accumulated depreciation                          |         |  10,000 |
|          | **To record depreciation for the month of June**  |         |         |

## Journal process flow

After the **transactions** are recorded in these journals, a summary of all the **transactions** is **posted** in each **journal** to the general ledger, which contains all 
of a company's **accounts**. An account is a separate, detailed record associated with a specific **asset**, **liability**, **equity**, **revenue**, or expense item.

Possible accounts: 

- Accounts Receivable (an asset account);
- Accounts Payable (a liability account);
- Retained Earnings (an equity account);
- Product Sales (a revenue account);
- Cost of Goods Sold (an expense account);

In summary, an accounting transaction is recorded into a journal, and then the information in the journal is **posted** into the **accounts** which are stored in the 
**general ledger**. The general journal is the repository for transactions that are not recorded in a specialty journal. Thus, the general journal can be considered an 
intermediate repository of information for some types of information, on the way to its final **recordation** in the general ledger.

## Issues

The general journal was more visible in the days of manual record keeping. With nearly everyone now using accounting software to record their accounting transactions, it is
not so readily apparent. Instead, the software makes it appear as though all transactions center around the **general ledger**, with no specialty journals in use at all.
