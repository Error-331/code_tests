# Quotation

A quotation is also often known as a **quote**. It is a document that a supplier will submit to a potential client that lists the proposed prices for the supplier's 
goods or services. The quotation is normally created based on certain conditions stipulated(предусмотренный) by the client.

Generally, if the supplier had fixed rates, there would be no need for a quotation. Therefore, a quotation is often required for services but is also commonly used by 
businesses that sell goods.

By sending the quotation to the potential client, the supplier is committing to the proposed price. The quotation, then, is quite different from an estimate (смета), as an 
estimate(смета) is not binding for the supplier. Because the quotation is binding, it should take into consideration all the costs associated with the job and be calculated 
with a markup(наценка) in order for the business to make a profit.

Quotations usually include quite a bit of details. In the quotation, the supplier will include a breakdown of the factors that have led to the specific price, such as 
taxes/VAT, material costs, labor, etc. Also included is the time frame for when a service will be completed or for when the goods will be delivered.

Quotations may often also include the time period for when it is valid (after the period is expired, a new quotation will be required), as well as a clarification of changes 
in price due to adjustments or modifications to the original invoice.
