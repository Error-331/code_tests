# Transaction

A transaction is a business event that has a **monetary impact** on an entity's **financial statements**, and is recorded as an entry in its accounting records. 

Examples: 

- Paying a supplier for services rendered or goods delivered;
- Paying a seller with cash and a note in order to obtain ownership of a property formerly owned by the seller;
- Paying an employee for hours worked;
- Receiving payment from a customer in exchange for goods or services delivered;

A high-volume transaction, such as a billing to a customer, may be recorded in a **specialized journal**, which is then summarized and posted to the **general ledger**. 
Alternatively, **lower-volume** transactions are posted **directly** to the **general ledger**.

When the cash basis of accounting is being used, a transaction is **recorded** when cash is spent or received. Alternatively, under the accrual basis of accounting, 
a transaction is recorded when revenue is realized or when an expense is incurred, irrespective of the flow of cash.
