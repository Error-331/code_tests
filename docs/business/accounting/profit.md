# Profit

Profit is the **positive amount** remaining after subtracting **expenses** incurred from the revenues generated over a designated period of time. This is one of the core measurements of 
the **viability** of a business, and so is closely watched by investors and lenders. 

## Difference Between Profit and Cash Flows

- the resulting profit may not match the **amount of cash flows** generated during the same reporting period; 
- this is because some of the accounting transactions required under the accrual basis of accounting do not match cash flows, such as the recordation of depreciation and amortization;

## Accounting for Profits

- profit is only accumulated in the accounting records for the **current year**; 
- after that, the amount of profit reported is shifted into **retained earnings**, which appears in a company's **balance sheet**; 
- these retained earnings may be kept within the business to support further growth, or may be distributed to owners in the form of **dividends**; 
- retained earnings may also be used to **buy back shares**;
