# Sales

Sales refers to the volume of goods and services sold by a business during a reporting period. When quantified into a monetary amount, it is positioned at the top of the income 
statement, after which operating and other expenses are subtracted to arrive at a profit or loss figure. Sales may also appear in the income statement as gross sales, 
after which sales returns and **allowances** are deducted from it to show a net sales figure.
