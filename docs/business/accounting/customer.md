# Customer

A customer is an **entity** that buys goods or services from third parties. Accumulating a **profitable** and recurring group of customers is the primary goal of a business, 
since this group generates **revenue** for the business.

A company that wants to remain profitable will closely follow the **satisfaction levels** of its customers and change its practices to match their requirements, so that they 
are willing to continue placing orders. Otherwise, a company must continually expend funds to locate new customers, which is an expensive proposition.
