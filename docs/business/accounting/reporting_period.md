periods from year to year, so that their financial statements can be compared to the ones produced for **prior years**.

On rare occasions, a reporting period may be for a **shortened** time period, such as a week or a few days. Such a period is used when a business is either **starting** up operations 
mid-month or terminating operations prior to the end of a normal reporting period. A shortened period may also be used when a **new corporate parent** is taking over at mid-month.
