# Income statement definition

The income statement presents the financial results of a business for a stated period of time. The statement quantifies (количественно) the amount of **revenue** generated and 
**expenses** incurred by an organization during a reporting period, as well as any resulting **net profit** or **net loss**. The income statement is an essential part of the financial 
statements that an organization releases. The other parts of the financial statements are the **balance sheet** and **statement of cash flows**. The income statement is also known as 
the **profit and loss statement** or **P&L**.

## Types of Income Statements

The most common type of income statement is the **classified income statement**. It is structured to include subtotals(промежуточные итоги) for the **gross margin**, all 
**operating expenses**, and again for all non-operating expenses. A business uses a classified income statement when it has a large number of revenue and expense accounts, and wants 
to consolidate(объединять) this information to make it more easily readable. _Larger businesses use this format_.

When a business collects information within a smaller number of accounts, it can get by with a **simpler reporting format**, which is the single step income statement. This format 
only uses **one subtotal** for all revenues and one subtotal for all expenses. The single step approach is used by many smaller organizations. Or, if the intent is to present just a 
few summary-level line items, then the **condensed**(сжатый) income statement format can be used. A condensed presentation likely only has one line item for revenue, one line item for 
the cost of goods sold, and one more for operating expenses. A condensed format is useful when reporting to outside users that only care about the general results reported by a 
business.

Quite a common format is the **comparative income statement**. This format shows the results of more than one **reporting period** in a set of adjacent columns. It is highly 
recommended for evaluating an organization’s results over time, through a simple side-by-side comparison of the reported information.

The income statement may be presented by itself on a single page, or it may be combined with other comprehensive income information. In the latter case, the report format is called a 
**statement of comprehensive income**.

## Income statement usage

An income statement can be used in several ways. One is to develop **ratios** that can pinpoint areas of improvement for a business, such as the **gross margin ratio** (calculated as 
the gross margin divided by sales) and the **net profit ratio** (calculated as the net profit or loss divided by sales). Another use is to track income statement **line items** over 
time, to see if there are any spikes or dips in the data that indicate the presence of problems that management should address.

## Contents of an Income Statement

There is no required template in the accounting standards for how the income statement is to be presented. The information contained within it can vary considerably by 
industry. There are certain common elements found in most income statements.

### Revenue

**Revenue is the sales generated by a business**. The **gross amount of revenue** is stated in the first line item of the income statement, after which deductions are listed for 
sales returns and allowances. These deductions are subtracted from the revenue figure to derive a net revenue number. Some organizations prefer to net these two line items together, 
so that only a net revenue figure is presented. Another option is for a business to present a different line item for each revenue source, such as one line for goods sold and another 
line for services sold.

### Cost of Goods Sold

The cost of goods sold line item appears directly beneath the revenue line item. It states the **total expense** associated with the goods and services sold during the stated 
reporting period. It contains the costs of **direct labor**, **direct materials**, and **factory overhead**. If only services are being sold, then this line may instead be stated as 
the cost of services provided, or the cost of sales.

### Gross Profit

The gross profit line item is revenue minus the cost of goods sold.

### Operating Expenses

The operating expenses section contains a number of **line items** that may instead be classified as selling, general and administrative expenses. It includes **all expenses** 
required to run the business that were not already included in the cost of goods sold. These expenses cover the areas of sales, marketing, IT, risk management, human resources, 
accounting, and finance. The line items in this section may be stated by function, such as rent expense, utilities expense, and compensation expense.

### Profit Before Tax

The profit before **tax line item** is the gross profit minus **all operating expenses**.

### Income Tax Expense

The **income tax expense** line item contains both paid and accrued income taxes for the reporting period.

### Profit After Tax

The profit after **tax line item** is the profit before tax minus the **income tax expense**.

## Presentation of the Income Statement

When presenting information in the income statement, the focus should be on providing information in a manner that maximizes information relevance to the reader.
