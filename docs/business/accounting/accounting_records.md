# Accounting records

Accounting records are the original source documents, **journal entries**, and **ledgers** that describe the accounting **transactions** of a business. Accounting records

derived from them are correct. **Auditors** and taxing authorities are the entities most likely to inspect accounting records.

The legal requirements to maintain accounting records are not consistent. At a minimum, records should be stored for as long as required to support an audit by the
