# Taxable profit 

Taxable profit is the profit upon which income taxes are payable. The composition of taxable profit varies by **taxation authority**, so it will vary depending upon the rules of the 
taxation authorities within which an entity is located or does business. For instance, a government may declare that certain qualifying organizations have nonprofit status, so that 
any of their qualifying earnings are not subject to income tax. Taxable profit is primarily based on **operating earnings**, but other types of taxable earnings can come from **dividend 
income**, **interest income**, and **capital gains** on the **sale of long-term assets**.

Different tax rates may apply to the various types of taxable earnings. There may also be graduated tax rates that apply to different amounts of taxable profit.
