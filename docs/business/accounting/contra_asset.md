# Contra Asset

A contra asset is a negative asset account that offsets the asset account with which it is paired. The purpose of a contra asset account is to **store** a reserve that 
**reduces** the **balance** in the **paired account**. By stating this information separately in a contra asset account, a user of financial information can see the extent to 
which a paired asset should be reduced.

The natural balance in a contra asset account is a **credit balance**, as opposed to the natural debit balance in all other asset accounts. There is no reason for there to ever 
be a debit balance in a contra asset account; thus, a debit balance probably indicates an incorrect accounting entry. When a contra asset transaction is created, the offset 
is a charge to the **income statement**, which **reduces profits**.

The proper size of a contra asset account can be the subject of considerable discussion between a company controller and the company's **auditors**. The auditors want to 
ensure that reserves are adequate, while the controller is more inclined to keep reserves low in order to increase the reported profit level.

## Presentation of Contra Assets

Contra assets may be stated in separate line items on the balance sheet. Or, if they contain relatively minor balances, they may be **aggregated** with their paired accounts 
and presented as a **single line** item in the balance sheet.

## Examples

- the **allowance for doubtful accounts** is a contra asset account to the **trade accounts receivable account** (the two accounts show the net amount of cash expected to be 
received from outstanding accounts receivable).;
- the **accumulated depreciation account** is a contra asset account to the **fixed assets account** (the two accounts show the net book value of a company's fixed assets);
- the **reserve for obsolete inventory**;
