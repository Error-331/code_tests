# Accounts

Accounts are the financial records of a business. All business **transactions** are recorded in the accounts, which are then aggregated into the **financial statements**. The accounts 
may be examined on an annual basis by auditors, to determine whether an entity's financial statements present fairly its financial results and condition. Depending on the applicable 
government regulations, a business will probably need to archive its accounts for a number of years, in case there is a tax audit or lawsuit that will require access to the accounts.
