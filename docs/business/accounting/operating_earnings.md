# Operating earnings definition

Operating earnings are the profits remaining after all **operating expenses** are **subtracted** from **revenues**. Operating expenses include the **cost of goods sold** and 
**selling**, **general** and **administrative expenses**. These earnings provide the best view into how well a business is performing, since it strips away all other expenses that 
do not relate to operations, such as **financing costs** and **taxes**. Given its importance, outside analysts routinely include operating earnings in their **analyses of businesses**, 
including how they compare to other firms within the same industry.

Management may choose to track this measurement more precisely, calculating it for each geographic location, brand, and/or product line. Doing so provides insights into where a firm 
is generating the **bulk of its profits**. Operating earnings can also be plotted on a **trend line**, to determine their **variability over time** (изменчивость с течением времени); 
a high level of variability can be a concern, since it increases the risk of not being able to generate a profit over the long term.

## Issues

A business that reports its operating earnings to the **investment community** may be tempted to emphasize this information, rather than its **net income figure** (чистый доход) 
(which includes both operating and financing results). An undue emphasis (чрезмерный акцент) on operating earnings can adversely skew(перекосит) investor perceptions of how well 
a business is performing. This is usually done when a business is reporting strong operating earnings, but poor net income.

Example:

- Company has $1 million of revenue;
- Cost of goods sold and sales - $400,000;
- General and administrative expenses - $500,000; 
- Based on this information, its operating earnings are $100,000; 
- This amount may be further reduced by taxes and interest expense (расходы в процентах), and may be increased by interest income (процентный доход);
