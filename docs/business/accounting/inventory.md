# Inventory

Inventory is an **asset** that is intended to be **sold in** the ordinary course of business. Inventory may not be immediately ready for sale. A business can save a great deal of cash by 
managing its inventory as tightly as possible.

## Categories

- Held for sale in the ordinary course of business; 
- That is in the process of being produced for sale;
- The materials or supplies intended for consumption in the production process;

## Classification

- **Raw materials**, includes materials intended to be consumed in the production of finished goods;
- **Work-in-process**, includes items that are in the midst of the production process, and which are not yet in a state ready for sale to customers;
- **Finished goods**, includes goods ready for sale to customers (may be termed merchandise in a retail environment where items are bought from suppliers in a state ready for sale);

## Benefits

- when less inventory must be kept on-site, a firm’s working capital requirements are correspondingly reduced;
- a business could arrange to have its suppliers ship goods directly to its customers (known as **drop shipping**), so that it eliminates the need for finished goods inventory entirely; 
- use suppliers located close to the company’s production facility, in order to take advantage of smaller and more frequent deliveries that reduce the amount of raw materials on hand; 
- position work stations closer together, so that parts processed on one machine can be handed off to the next work station, rather than letting them pile up in between;
