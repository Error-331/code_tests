# Net loss

- Net loss is the excess of **expenses** over **revenues**;
- All expenses are included in this calculation, including the effects of **income taxes**;
- The net loss concept is useful for determining the amount of **income taxes owed**, since a net loss in one period can be used to offset the **taxable** income in 
  another period, resulting in a reduced income tax **liability**;
- The net loss appears at the bottom of the income statement, after all line items associated with revenues and expenses;

Example:

Revenues of $900,000 and expenses of $1,000,000 yield a net loss of $100,000.
