# Gross Margin

Gross margin is a companyâ€™s **net sales** minus its **cost of goods** sold. The gross margin reveals the amount that a business earns from the sale of its products and services, before 
the deduction of any **selling and administrative expenses**. 

The amount of **gross margin** earned by a business dictates the level of funding left with which to pay for selling and administrative activities and financing costs, as well as to 
generate a profit. It is a key concern in the derivation of a budget, since it drives the amount of expenditures that can be made in these additional expense classifications.

## Gross Margin Formula

The formula for the gross margin is **net sales** less the **cost of goods sold**. It is better to use net sales than gross sales, since a large number of deductions from gross sales 
could skew the results of the calculation. Gross margin is frequently expressed as a percentage, called the gross margin percentage. The calculation is:

(Net sales - Cost of goods sold) / Net sales

Example:

- a company has sales of **$1,000,000** and cost of goods sold of **$750,000**, which results in a gross margin of **$250,000** and a gross margin percentage of 25%;
- the gross margin percentage may be stated in a company's income statement;

## Gross Margin Analysis

- useful when tracked on a trend line, to see if there are any significant changes that may require further investigation; 
- a decline in the gross margin percentage may be cause for **considerable concern** -  it can imply a decline in the competitiveness of a company's products in the marketplace;
- gross margin includes an allocation of factory overhead costs, some of which may be fixed costs or mixed costs; 
- because of the overhead cost inclusion, gross margin is not the same as contribution margin (which only reduces sales by the amount of any variable expenses incurred);
- **gross margin analysis** should be accompanied by a consideration of the rate at which **inventory turns over**;
