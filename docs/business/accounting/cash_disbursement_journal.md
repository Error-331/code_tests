# Cash Disbursement Journal

The cash disbursement journal is a detailed record of the cash payments made by a business. The journal itemizes when check and other types of payments are made, as well as 
the amounts paid, the names of the recipients, and the accounts charged. This journal is a good source document for tracking down the specifics regarding individual payments. 
The information in the cash disbursement journal is periodically summarized and forwarded to the **general ledger**.

## Reconciling the Cash Disbursement Journal

The ending balance in the cash disbursement journal should be compared to the related **ending balance** in the **general ledger** as part of the month-end closing process. If there is a 
disparity, it is likely to be caused by additional entries piling up in the journal that were not posted to the **general ledger**. It is also possible that a journal entry was made 
directly to the **general ledger account** that was not also entered in the journal.
