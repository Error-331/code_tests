# Debits and Credits

Business **transactions** are events that have a monetary impact on the financial statements of an organization. When accounting for these **transactions**, we record numbers 
in two accounts, where the debit column is on the left and the credit column is on the right.

## Debits

A debit is an accounting entry that either increases an **asset** or **expense account**, or decreases a **liability** or **equity** account. It is positioned to the left in an 
accounting entry.

## Credits

A credit is an accounting entry that either increases a **liability** or **equity account**, or decreases an **asset** or **expense** account. It is positioned to the right in an 
accounting entry.

## Debit and Credit Usage

Whenever an accounting transaction is created, at least two accounts are always impacted, with a debit entry being recorded against one account and a credit entry being recorded
against the other account. There is no upper limit to the number of accounts involved in a transaction - but the minimum is **no less than two accounts**. The totals of the debits 
and credits for any transaction must always equal each other, so that an accounting transaction is always said to be _in balance_. If a transaction were not in balance, then it would 
not be possible to create financial statements. Thus, the use of debits and credits in a two-column transaction recording format is the most essential of all controls over accounting 
accuracy.

There can be considerable confusion about the inherent meaning of a debit or a credit. For example, if you debit a cash account, then this means that the amount of cash on hand 
increases. However, if you debit an accounts payable account, this means that the amount of accounts payable liability decreases. These differences arise because debits and credits 
have different impacts across several broad types of accounts, which are:

- Asset accounts (счета активов) - a debit increases the balance and a credit decreases the balance;
- Liability accounts (счета ответственности) - a debit decreases the balance and a credit increases the balance;
- Equity accounts (акционерные счета) - a debit decreases the balance and a credit increases the balance;

The reason for this seeming reversal of the use of debits and credits is caused by the underlying accounting equation upon which the entire structure of accounting transactions are 
built, which is:

`Assets = Liabilities + Equity`
`Активы = Обязательства + Собственный капитал`

User can only have assets if you have paid for them with liabilities or equity, the user must have one in order to have the other. Consequently, if the user create a transaction 
with a debit and a credit, you are usually increasing an asset while also increasing a liability or equity account (or vice versa). There are some exceptions, such as increasing 
one asset account while decreasing another asset account. If the user are more concerned with accounts that appear on the income statement, then these additional rules apply:

- Revenue accounts (счета доходов) - a debit decreases the balance and a credit increases the balance;
- Expense accounts (расходные счета) - a debit increases the balance and a credit decreases the balance;
- Gain accounts (счета прибыли) - a debit decreases the balance and a credit increases the balance;
- Loss accounts (счета убытков) - a debit increases the balance and a credit decreases the balance;

Debits always go in the left column, and credits always go in the right column. There are no exceptions.

## Debit and Credit Rules

### Changes to Debit Balances

All accounts that normally contain a debit balance will increase in amount when a debit (left column) is added to them, and reduced when a credit (right column) is added to them. The 
types of accounts to which this rule applies are **expenses**, **assets**, and **dividends**.

### Changes to Credit Balances

All accounts that normally contain a credit balance will increase in amount when a credit (right column) is added to them, and reduced when a debit (left column) is added to them. 
The types of accounts to which this rule applies are **liabilities**, **revenues**, and **equity**.

### Totals Must Match

The total amount of debits must equal the total amount of credits in a transaction. Otherwise, an accounting transaction is said to be **unbalanced**, and will not be accepted by 
the accounting software.

## Debits and Credits in Common Accounting Transactions

- Sale for cash: Debit the cash account | Credit the revenue account;
- Sale on credit: Debit the accounts receivable account | Credit the revenue account;
- Receive cash in payment of an account receivable: Debit the cash account | Credit the accounts receivable account;
- Purchase supplies from supplier for cash: Debit the supplies expense account | Credit the cash account;
- Purchase supplies from supplier on credit: Debit the supplies expense account | Credit the accounts payable account;
- Purchase inventory from supplier for cash: Debit the inventory account | Credit the cash account;
- Purchase inventory from supplier on credit: Debit the inventory account | Credit the accounts payable account;
- Pay employees: Debit the wages expense and payroll tax accounts | Credit the cash account;
- Take out a loan: Debit cash account | Credit loans payable account;
- Repay a loan: Debit loans payable account | Credit cash account;

Example 1:

Arnold Corporation sells a product to a customer for $1,000 in cash. This results in revenue of $1,000 and cash of $1,000. Arnold must record an increase of the cash (asset) account 
with a debit, and an increase of the revenue account with a credit. The entry is:

| Date     | Account |   Debit |  Credit | 
|:---------|:--------|--------:|--------:|
| June 30  | Cash    |   1,000 |         |
|          | Revenue |         |   1,000 |

Example 2:

Arnold Corporation also buys a machine for $15,000 on credit. This results in an addition to the Machinery fixed assets account with a debit, and an increase in the accounts payable 
(liability) account with a credit. The entry is:

| Date     | Account                  |  Debit | Credit | 
|:---------|:-------------------------|-------:|-------:|
| June 30  | Machinery - Fixed Assets | 15,000 |        |
|          | Accounts Payable         |        | 15,000 |

## Debit and Credit Abbreviations

A debit is commonly abbreviated as **dr.** in an accounting transaction, while a credit is abbreviated as **cr.** in the transaction.
