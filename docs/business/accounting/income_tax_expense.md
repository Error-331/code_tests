# Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense is the amount of expense that a business recognizes in an **accounting period** for the **government tax** related to its **taxable profit**. The amount of 
income tax expense recognized is unlikely to exactly match the **standard income tax percentage** that is applied to business income, since there are a number of differences between 
the reportable amount of income under the **GAAP** or **IFRS** frameworks and the reportable amount of income allowed under the applicable government **tax code**. For example, 
many companies use **straight-line depreciation** (прямолинейная амортизация) to calculate the depreciation reported in their financial statements, but employ **accelerated 
depreciation**(ускоренная амортизация) to derive their **taxable profit**; the result is a taxable income figure(показатель налогооблагаемого дохода) that is lower than the 
**reported income figure**(отчетная цифра дохода). Some corporations put so much effort into delaying or avoiding taxes that their **income tax expense** is nearly zero, despite 
reporting large profits.

The calculation of income tax expense can be so complicated that this task is outsourced to a **tax expert**. If so, a company usually records an approximate tax expense on a monthly 
basis that is based on a **historical percentage**, which is adjusted on a **quarterly** or **longer** basis by the tax expert.

## Presentation of Income Tax Expense

The income tax expense is reported as a line item in the corporate income statement, while any **liability** for unpaid income taxes is reported in the income **tax payable** line 
item on the balance sheet.
