# Anti-detect browser

Anti-detect browsers allow you to bypass the protective measures of sites - and this can be used in a variety of areas, solving a variety of problems, from multi-accounting 
in traffic arbitrage to bonus hunting and "white" segments of the web.

Anti-detect browser allows you to replace data about the user's computer:

- operating system;
- number of screens (their size);
- hardware;
- fonts;
- browser extensions;
- many other parameters;

This allows you to use multiple accounts on services such as Facebook, Instagram, etc. Services request all this data to know who their visitor is and what they are doing.
"Anti-detects" help change user data to prevent the service from identifying the user.

## Anti-detect browser for anonymity on the internet

- it is not enough to simply replace IP, there are a lot of other parameters that could be collected from the user;
- all this data collected is called a "digital fingerprint";
- this data is requested from the user every day by a wide variety of sites, including social networks and marketplaces;
- *anti-detect browser helps to replace all the information that the visited site is capable of reading*;
- from hardware to operating system parameters, almost everything can be replaced;
- in anti-detect browsers you can “compose” both random configurations and independently create the most plausible fingerprint.
- in combination with good proxies, this provides a good level of anonymity;

## Anti-detect browser for traffic arbitrage

- to find, launch and scale advertising strategies, user needs dozens of advertising accounts, but in large advertising networks such as Facebook Ads, Google Ads, etc., they cannot be officially used;
- when, for example, Facebook “sees” that the same person is logging into many different accounts from one device on one IP, it blocks them;
- arbitrageurs also lose some of their accounts due to advertising that violates the site’s rules, which is why new ones are always needed;
- some advertising networks have restrictions on the amounts spent, in this case users also cannot do without multiple accounts;
- using anti-detect browser, user can make convincing "casts" by changing all the important parameters, then checks of advertising platforms will not reveal anything suspicious;
- also, different people will be able to log into one account;

## E-Commerce: Safe self-buyout and feedback boosting on marketplaces

- Anti-detect browser is useful for sellers on marketplaces as a tool for anonymity when engaging in self-buying and feedback manipulation;
- Self-buyouts are prohibited by the rules of marketplaces and can result in a fine or even expulsion from the marketplace;
- Anti-detect browser gives possibility to easily create new accounts and order goods from them to different pick-up points;
- All that remains is to pick it up from the pick-up point, leave good ratings, attach a photo of the product and write a positive review;
- The product is then repackaged and returned to the warehouse for resale;

## Bounty & Airdrop: multi-accounting in crypto

- "Starter" crypto projects often give away their currency to users at the start;
- Some people give away small amounts of money just for registering – this is called an “airdrop” (there is a small amount, but no effort is required from the user);
- Some people set more complex conditions - for example, a post on Twitter that will bring in several new users;
- By using multiple accounts through the anti-detect browser, you can receive many times more bonuses;

## Anti-detect Browser for Web Scraping

Anti-detect Browser helps to bypass the protection of websites from data collection and is a convenient tool for quick web scraping without the need to install and configure 
complex programs.

## Multi-accounting in Digital Agencies

- Many agencies do not launch advertising from their own accounts, but try to create a separate account for each client;
- Social networks and advertising networks are against any multi-accounting and can ban these working accounts;
- Anti-detect browser will protect the agency as well as the arbitrators;
- If anti-detect browser used correctly, "fingerprints" set properly - accounts will easily exist for decades;
