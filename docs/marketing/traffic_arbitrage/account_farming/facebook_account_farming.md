# Facebook account farming

- It is important to remember that the farm should resemble the action of a real user;
- If you farm multiple accounts, avoid template actions;
- Perform actions at different time intervals and in different sequences;
- If Facebook "exposes" a farming template, it can ban the entire chain of accounts;

## Actions and timing when farming Facebook accounts

- Once you have logged into your account through the anti-detect browser, leave it idle until the next day;
- The next day the farming begins;
- All actions should be completed within two weeks;
- The order and day of execution are determined at will;
- Some actions should be performed daily, for example, "liking" or writing comments;

Algorithm:

1. Fill out your profile - fill in the empty fields in your profile;
2. Choose a different filling strategy for each account (for example, in one account you can fill it in a day, and in another you can spread it out over two weeks);
3. Like and comment on posts in the community (the number is determined independently);
4. Publications - place prepared photos on your page (photos must be unique if taken from open sources);
5. Subscribe to communities, including dating communities, this will help you find "friends" and increase social activity (choose communities by account geo or proxy);
6. Leave a note in a dating group with the caption "looking for friends" or "looking for a relationship" (this will help you receive friend requests); 
7. Add and remove other users periodically;
8. Send messages to friends you've added or reply to their messages;
9. Visit stores and websites that may contain Facebook pixels (this is necessary for the social network to notice your activity);
10. When surfing and other activities, try to use the same geo/address pool, preferably close to the place where the account was registered;
11. Play games available on Facebook;
12. Do nothing on your account periodically to avoid being overly active during weekends;

Additionally;

1. Create a FanPage on day 7-8 of farming; 
    - Fill in all the information about the page; 
    - Add a photo and cover; 
    - Post neutral content that can be related to the topic of your advertising;
2. Create a Business Manager somewhere around day 10;
3. After these steps, you can continue farming as long as you want, but before launching advertising, leave your account inactive for 1-2 days;
