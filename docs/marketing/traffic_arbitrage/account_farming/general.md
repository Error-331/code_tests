# Account farming

Account farming is the act of performing actions within an account that mimic the behavior of real users so that Facebook believes that this is a real person's profile.

To simulate user behavior, the following is required:

- Completed profile: added photos and posts, specified information about age, gender, city;
- Interaction: likes, reposts, comments, subscriptions to other users' pages;
- Social activity: finding friends and communicating with them;

## How much to farm Facebook accounts

- The duration of farming depends on the quality of the accounts;
- Purchased "autoregs" (registered using auto-registration tool) without farming and accounts that were registered independently are farmed on average from two weeks to a month;
- You need to look at the result and choose the optimal time;
- If the user bought high-quality Facebook farm accounts, then it will be enough to let them “lie down” for a day after adding them to the *anti-detect browser*;.
- During periods when social network is "very stormy", it is worth conducting a longer farm, which will help increase the level of trust in the account;
