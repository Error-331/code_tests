#### God Only, You Can Trust (December 26)

*"Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended"*

**(Matthew 26:33)**

...promise which has no better foundation than a human resolve will fall to the ground...

...What is man's word? - An earthen pot broken with a stroke...

...What is your own resolve? - A blossom, which, with God's care, may come to fruit, but which, left to itself, will fall to the ground with the first wind 
that moves the bough...

...On man's word hang only what it will bear... 

...On thine own resolve depend not at all...

...On the promise of thy God hang time and eternity...
