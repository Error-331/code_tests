# Difference between balanced/unbalanced audio

- balanced audio has less risk for unwanted noise; 
- unbalanced audio can pick up humming or buzzing sounds in certain environments;
- balanced audio will give a better, stronger audio signal without any extraneous noises; 
- unbalanced audio, is susceptible to picking up noise and interference over longer distances; 
- the ground wire in an unbalanced audio cable can pick up unwanted noise as the audio signal travels through it;

## Unbalanced Audio

- an audio cable carrying an unbalanced signal uses two wires: a _signal_ and a _ground_;
- the signal wire carries the audio signal to where it needs to go; 
- the ground wire acts as a reference point for the signal (ground wire itself also acts like an antenna, picking up unwanted noise along the way);
- unbalanced cables best used for short distances;

### Unbalanced Cable Types

#### RCA Cables

- RCA audio cables are unbalanced analog audio connections that send stereo audio over a right channel (red tip) and left channel (white or black tip); 
- An RCA unbalanced signal typically shouldn't run over 25 feet;

#### Quarter-Inch TS Cables

- Quarter-inch TS (tip, sleeve) cables are generally used for unbalanced signals; 
- These are most commonly used with electric guitars, which often output to an amplifier; 

## Balanced Audio

- a balanced audio cable has a ground wire, but it also carries two copies of the same incoming audio signal, sometimes referred to as a hot (positive) and cold (negative) signal;
- the two signals are reversed in polarity, so as they travel down the cable, they cancel each other out;
- once the hot and cold signal get to the other end of the cable, however, the polarity of the cold signal is flipped, so both signals are in phase, and perfectly in sync;
- if the cable picks up noise along the way, the noise added to both of those cables is not reversed in polarity;
- balanced signals send two in-phase signals, they’re also louder (roughly 6–10 dB) than what unbalanced signals can provide;

### Balanced Cable Types

#### XLR

- XLR cables can send balanced audio signals up to 200 feet; 
- there are three male pins inside the connector: the groundwire, the hot signal, and the cold signal;

### Quarter-Inch TRS

- TRS stands for tip, ring, sleeve, and can be used to send either mono (balanced) or stereo (unbalanced) signals;
