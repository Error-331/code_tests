# DRM

- can broadcast on frequencies below 30 MHz (long wave, medium wave and short wave), which allow for very-long-distance signal propagation;
- "DRM+" on VHF bands; 
- the encoding and decoding can be performed with digital signal processing, complex encoding and decoding can be thus performed;
- DRM can transmit other data besides the audio channels (datacasting) â€” as well as RDS-type metadata or program-associated data as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) does; 
- DRM services can be operated in many different network configurations, from a traditional AM one-service one-transmitter model to a multi-service multi-transmitter model;
- hybrid operation, where the same transmitter delivers both analogue and DRM services simultaneously is also possible.
- DRM incorporates Emergency Warning Features that can override other programming and activates radios which are in standby in order to receive emergency broadcasts;
