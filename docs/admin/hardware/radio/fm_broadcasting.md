## Antenna calculation

### Simple dipole

- divide 468 by the frequency to which you want to connect (e.g., 468/108MHz would become 4.3);
- divide the resulting number by 2 (e.g., 4.3/2 would become 2.15);
- multiply the resulting number by 12 inches (30.5 cm) to find the antenna length (e.g., 2.15*12 inches would become 25.8 inches);
