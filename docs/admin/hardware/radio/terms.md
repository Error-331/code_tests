- Modulation/demodulation - is the process of adding information to a radio signal so that the information can be transmitted over the air. Ham radios primarily use two kinds of modulation: 
amplitude modulation(AM) and frequency modulation (FM), similar to what you receive on your car radio or home stereo;

- Demodulation - is the process of recovering information from a received signal;

- Modes - is a specific combination of modulation and information (voice, data, video, Morse code, etc.);

- Repeaters - are relay stations that listen on one frequency and retransmit what they hear on a different frequency;

- Services - different users of the radio spectrum;

- Citizens Band (CB) - CB radio uses 40 channels near the 28 MHz ham band. CB radios are low-power and useful for local communications only, although the radio waves sometimes travel long
distances (no license needed);

- Family Radio Service (FRS) and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) - these popular radios, such as the Motorola Talkabout models, are designed for shortrange communications between family 
members. Both operate with low power on UHF frequencies. FRS operation is unlicensed, but using the GMRS channels does require a license;

- Public-safety and commercial mobile radio - the handheld and mobile radios used by police officers, firefighters, construction workers, and delivery-company couriers are similar in many
ways to VHF and UHF ham radios (require a license to operate);

- WiFi - operates on the 2.4- or 5.6-GHz bands;
