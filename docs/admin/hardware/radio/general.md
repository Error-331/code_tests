# Radio

- Radio waves are another form of light that travels at the same speed: **186,000 miles per second**;
- Radio waves can get to the Moon and back in 2½ seconds or circle the Earth in **1⁄7 second**;
- The waves are made up of both **electric** and **magnetic** fields (a field is just a way of storing energy in space) 
- The radio wave’s field makes charged particles — such as the electrons in a wire - move in sync with the radio wave;
- The fields of a radio wave **oscillate** (vary in direction back and forth)ж
- _The number of cycles in one second is the frequency of the wave, measured in hertz_ (abbreviated Hz)ж
- The wave always moves the same distance - one wavelength - during one cycle;
- The higher the wave’s frequency, the faster a cycle completes and the less time it has to move during one cycle; 
- High-frequency waves have short wavelengths, and lowfrequency waves have long wavelengths;
- Radio waves oscillate at frequencies between the upper end of human hearing at about 20 kilohertz, or kHz (kilo is the metric abbreviation meaning 1,000), on up to 1,000 gigahertz, or 
GHz (giga is the metric abbreviation meaning 1 billion);

Formulas:

_Wavelength = Speed of light / Frequency of the wave_

_Wavelength in meters = 300,000,000 / Frequency in hertz_

_Frequency in hertz = 300,000,000 / Wavelength in meters_

_f = c / λ and λ = c / f (f - frequency, c - speed of light)_

_f = 300 / λ in m and λ = 300 / f in MHz_

Example:

A wave with a frequency of 3.75 MHz has a wavelength of 300 / 3.75 = 80 meters. Similarly, a wavelength of 2 meters corresponds to a frequency of 300 / 2 = 150 MHz.

## Spectrum

- The radio spectrum (also known as radio frequency or RF) is one of such parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that overlaps our sub-THz range at its lower end;
- RF bands spread in the range between 30 kHz and 300 GHz (alternative point of view offers coverage 3 KHz – 300 GHz);
- A radio frequency band is a small contiguous section of the radio spectrum frequencies, in which channels are usually used or set aside for use;
- For example, broadcasting, mobile radio, or navigation devices, will be allocated in non-overlapping ranges of frequencies;

#### MW (medium wave) frequency

- Medium wave (MW) is the part of the medium frequency (MF) radio band used mainly for AM radio broadcasting;
- provides about 120 channels with more limited sound quality; 
- during the **daytime**, reception is usually limited to more local stations; 
- improved signal propagation at **night** allows the reception of much longer distance signals (within a range of about 2,000 km or 1,200 miles); 
- **amplitude modulation (AM)** is often more prone to interference by various electronic devices, especially power supplies and computers; 
- strong transmitters cover larger areas than on the FM broadcast band but require more energy and longer antennas; 
- **digital modes are possible but have not reached momentum yet**;

| Area              	  | kHz (centre) | Spacing | Channels |
|:------------------------|:-------------|:--------|:---------|
| Europe, Asia, Africa    |	531–1,602    | 9 kHz   | 120      |
| Australia               |	531–1,701    | 9 kHz   | 131      |

#### SW short wave frequency

- is radio transmission using radio frequencies in the shortwave bands (SW); 
- there is no official definition of the band range, but it always includes all of the high frequency band (HF) - 3 to 30 MHz (100 to 10 meters);
- above the medium frequency band (MF), to the bottom of the VHF band;
- radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere;
- **shortwave radio can be used for communication over very long distances**;
- SW is often used by airplanes;
- in the developed world, shortwave reception is very difficult in urban areas because of excessive noise from switched-mode power adapters, fluorescent or LED light sources, 
internet modems and routers, computers and many other sources of radio interference;

## Radio wave propagation

- **propagation of radio waves is affected by the Sun, the characteristics of the atmosphere, and even the properties of ground and water**;
- ground wave propagation can support communication up to 100 miles (160.934 km) but varies greatly with the frequency being used;
- at HF and sometimes at VHF, the very highest layers of the atmosphere (ionosphere), bend the waves back to Earth;
- depending on the angle at which the signal is reflected, a sky wave 'hop' can be as long as 2,000 miles (3218.688 km); 
- **HF signals** often bounce between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere several times so that contacts are made **worldwide**;
- Tropospheric propagation, or tropo, occurs along weather fronts, temperature inversions, and other large-scale features in the atmosphere; 
- Tropo is common at frequencies in the VHF and UHF range, often supporting contacts over 1,000 miles or more;
- when the aurora is strong, it absorbs HF signals but reflects VHF and UHF signals while adding a characteristic rasp or buzz;
- meteor trails are very hot from the friction of the meteoroid’s passage through the atmosphere — so hot that the gases become electrically conductive and reflect signals until they cool; 

## Noise

One limiting factor for all wireless communication is noise. 

- home appliances make noise - lots of it; 
- FM was invented and used for broadcasting because of its noise-rejection properties. Even
- by using sophisticated methods of turning speech and data into digital codes, digital technology strips away layers of noise, leaving only the desired signal;
- using **WSJT-X** software, hams can communicate with signals hundreds of times weaker than the natural noise level, even bouncing their signals off the moon with simple equipment;

## Misc

### Demodulator

A Demodulator (short Demod) recovers (demodulates) the original information from an intermediate frequency (IF) that is provided to it by a tuner. 

- the type of demodulator IC used for this task of information recovery is specific and dependent upon the nature of the signal transmission scheme involved;
- in the case of analog TV, the IF inputted into the demodulator contains the composite signal that was originally modulated onto the RF carrier; 
- after recovery, the demodulator outputs a CVSB signal, which will then need to be digitized through sampling techniques performed by a A/V decoder;

#### TV transmission schemes

- in the case of digital TV transmission schemes, the IF inputted into the demodulator contains a MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) that was originally modulated onto the RF carrier; 
- in the process of recovering digital TV TS, digital demodulators will perform Forward Error Correction (Convolutional Viterbi- and Block-Reed-Solomon-Decoding); 
- this whole process is sometimes referred to as RF-to-bits, for, unlike the case with analog IF demodulators, the recovered signal outputted from the digital demodulator is
already a digital bit stream (specifically a TS); 
- the TS will in turn be sent to a decoder in order to display (and, depending upon what format the underlying video content contained within the TS was encoded with, this could be a 
MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 decoder  and either hardware or software based);

### Digital Code Squelch (DCS)

- or CDCSS, or Digital Private Line (DPL);
- is a further development of the continuous tone-coded squelch system or **CTCSS** that uses a slow-speed, binary data stream passed as sub-audible data along with the transmission;
- consists of a 23-bit telegram sent repeatedly on the channel at 134 bits per second along with the voice transmission; 
- allows for over 100 possible fleet codes to be used;
- gives it an advantage over the CTCSS tones in that there are more possible codes to use;
- **it does use more bandwidth and can be affected by voice tones below 300 Hz if not properly filtered by the radio circuitry**;

### Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System

- known by a number of different trade names such as Private Line® (PL) by Motorola, Channel Guard® (CG) by General Electric and generically as tone **squelch**;
- 
- it is a use of sub-audible tones that are transmitted along with the speech portion of the transmission which allows more than one agency (or fleet) to use the same radio frequency 
without hearing the other agency on that frequency; 

- receivers for agency XYZ are set to only open their audio squelch when the proper sub-audible frequency tone is part of the transmission;

- sharing of frequencies by agencies is less common than it once was, CTCSS is more commonly used by repeater systems to prevent noise or interference from causing the repeater squawk 
obnoxiously, and by receivers as an extra measure of squelch (to prevent engine noise from breaking squelch);
