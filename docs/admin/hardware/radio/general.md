# Radio

- Radio waves are another form of light that travels at the same speed: **186,000 miles per second**;
- Radio waves can get to the Moon and back in 2½ seconds or circle the Earth in **1⁄7 second**;
- The waves are made up of both **electric** and **magnetic** fields (a field is just a way of storing energy in space) 
- The radio wave’s field makes charged particles — such as the electrons in a wire - move in sync with the radio wave;
- The fields of a radio wave **oscillate** (vary in direction back and forth)ж
- _The number of cycles in one second is the frequency of the wave, measured in hertz_ (abbreviated Hz)ж
- The wave always moves the same distance - one wavelength - during one cycle;
- The higher the wave’s frequency, the faster a cycle completes and the less time it has to move during one cycle; 
- High-frequency waves have short wavelengths, and lowfrequency waves have long wavelengths;
- Radio waves oscillate at frequencies between the upper end of human hearing at about 20 kilohertz, or kHz (kilo is the metric abbreviation meaning 1,000), on up to 1,000 gigahertz, or 
GHz (giga is the metric abbreviation meaning 1 billion);

Formulas:

_Wavelength = Speed of light / Frequency of the wave_

_Wavelength in meters = 300,000,000 / Frequency in hertz_

_Frequency in hertz = 300,000,000 / Wavelength in meters_

_f = c / λ and λ = c / f (f - frequency, c - speed of light)_

_f = 300 / λ in m and λ = 300 / f in MHz_

Example:

A wave with a frequency of 3.75 MHz has a wavelength of 300 / 3.75 = 80 meters. Similarly, a wavelength of 2 meters corresponds to a frequency of 300 / 2 = 150 MHz.

## Spectrum

- The radio spectrum (also known as radio frequency or RF) is one of such parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that overlaps our sub-THz range at its lower end;
- RF bands spread in the range between 30 kHz and 300 GHz (alternative point of view offers coverage 3 KHz – 300 GHz);
- A radio frequency band is a small contiguous section of the radio spectrum frequencies, in which channels are usually used or set aside for use;
- For example, broadcasting, mobile radio, or navigation devices, will be allocated in non-overlapping ranges of frequencies;

## Radio wave propagation

- **propagation of radio waves is affected by the Sun, the characteristics of the atmosphere, and even the properties of ground and water**;
- ground wave propagation can support communication up to 100 miles (160.934 km) but varies greatly with the frequency being used;
- at HF and sometimes at VHF, the very highest layers of the atmosphere (ionosphere), bend the waves back to Earth;
- depending on the angle at which the signal is reflected, a sky wave 'hop' can be as long as 2,000 miles (3218.688 km); 
- **HF signals** often bounce between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere several times so that contacts are made **worldwide**;
- Tropospheric propagation, or tropo, occurs along weather fronts, temperature inversions, and other large-scale features in the atmosphere; 
- Tropo is common at frequencies in the VHF and UHF range, often supporting contacts over 1,000 miles or more;
- when the aurora is strong, it absorbs HF signals but reflects VHF and UHF signals while adding a characteristic rasp or buzz;
- meteor trails are very hot from the friction of the meteoroid’s passage through the atmosphere — so hot that the gases become electrically conductive and reflect signals until they cool; 

## Noise

One limiting factor for all wireless communication is noise. 

- home appliances make noise - lots of it; 
- FM was invented and used for broadcasting because of its noise-rejection properties. Even
- by using sophisticated methods of turning speech and data into digital codes, digital technology strips away layers of noise, leaving only the desired signal;
- using **WSJT-X** software, hams can communicate with signals hundreds of times weaker than the natural noise level, even bouncing their signals off the moon with simple equipment;
