# CPU

## General

- Microarchitecture is important (like `coffee lake`);

- SRAM (Static random-access memory) - internal cpu cache;

- level 1 cache (L1 Data and L Inst.) - same speed as CPU;

- level 2 cache - bigger, feeds level 1 cache, half speed of the CPU;

- level 3 cache (l3 cache) - nearly as motherboard, faster than regular RAM;

- 32 bit process supports less or equal to 4 GB of RAM;

- speed of motherboard is important (to know which cpu it can handle);

## Pin array

- PGA;
- LGA;

- LGA 1151 (number of pins) - mainstream socket (intel);
- LGA 2066 (for enthusiasts) - high end cpu (intel);

- AM 4 (amd) - like lga 1151 (amd;
- TR 4 (amd) - for high end cpu (amd;
