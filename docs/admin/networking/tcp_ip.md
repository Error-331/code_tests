# TCP/IP

## TCP

- used for applications that require the establishment of connections (as well as TCP’s other service features), such as FTP;

## UDP

- used by other applications that don’t need connections or other features, but do need the faster performance that UDP can offer by not needing to make such connections before sending data;

## Transport layer 

- TCP (connection-oriented);
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) (connectionless);
