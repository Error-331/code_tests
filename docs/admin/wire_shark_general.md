# WireShark

## Cases

### Monitor WiFi traffic

- Find WiFi device using `iwconfig` (example: `wlx0008caa46de5`);
- Turn off current WiFi connection: `sudo ifconfig wlx0008caa46de5 down`;
- Turn on monitor mode for WiFi connection: `sudo iwconfig wlx0008caa46de5 mode monitor`;
- Turn on current WiFi connection: `sudo ifconfig wlx0008caa46de5 up`;
- Find appropriate channel in WireShark (mon0-mon2);
- Sometimes may need to start airmon-ng: `sudo airmon-ng start wlx0008caa46de5`;
- Sometimes may need to start airodump-ng: `sudo airodump-ng wlx0008caa46de5`;

## Usage

- Monitor HTTP traffic and not DNS:

```bash

host 192.168.0.104 and port 80 and not arp

```

- Monitor HTTP traffic:

```bash

port 80 and not arp (tun0 - vpn)

```
