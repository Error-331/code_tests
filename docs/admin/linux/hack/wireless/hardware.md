# Hardware for Wireless hacking

## Special modes

### Monitor mode

Monitor mode allows you to capture data sent and received by wireless devices/networks nearby. Without it, you can't see which devices are active and what's happening in a network.

### Packet injection

Packet injection allows you to craft and inject or send data to wireless devices/networks nearby. Without it, you can't intercept or manipulate any activity from within any network.

## Wireless Adapters 

- ALFA AWUS036NHA - stable and good;
- TP-LINK TL-WN722N V1 (Atheros AR9271) - best, but can contain wrong chip;
- ALFA AWUS036NH - good for wardriving;

### Chipsets that support monitor mode AND packet injection

- Atheros AR9271
- Ralink RT3070
- Ralink RT3572
