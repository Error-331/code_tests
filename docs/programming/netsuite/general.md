## Entity

- is a generic category that includes individual people or companies; 
- in database parlance, that single place is called a record;
- entities can be a lead/prospect/customer, a contact, a vendor, a partner, or an employee;

Depending on what stage of the lifecycle it’s in, an entity may be called:

1. lead - when you first make contact with a potential customer.
2. prospect - after sales team contacts him and verifies his interest in purchasing;
3. customer - when he buys something;

### Contacts

- contacts are individuals who you have business relationships with, including colleagues, friends, and other acquaintances who you would keep in an address book;
- contacts can be associated with leads, prospects, customers, vendors, and partners (private contacts are also possible);

### Vendors

- vendors supply goods or services to run the business; 
- vendor records allows to keep track of the vendor’s location and contact information, track the items that were purchased from them, and report on financial data based on purchases; 
- vendors can also have access to account by which orders were made to view those orders;

### Partners

### Employees

### Items
