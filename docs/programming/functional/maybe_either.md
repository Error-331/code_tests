# Maybe/Either

- Maybe is one (value) or none â€“ ie, you have a value or you have nothing;

- Either is a logical disjunction, but you always have at least one (value) - ie, you have one or the other, but not both;

- Either is the perfect representation of a branch in your code - it's going to go one way or the other;

## Maybe

### Example

Looking for an item in a list. if the list contains it, we get (Maybe x) otherwise we get Nothing.

## Either

- Right is the right (correct) way; 

- Left is the wrong way (Error);
