# AI 

## Types

- Supervised;
- Unsupervised;
- Semisupervised;
- Reinforcement;

## Training

- is the process of attempting to improve a machine learning algorithm by having it review data and improve its mathematical structure to make better predictions in the future;

### Training set

- training data, this is the data that will be used by algorithm for it to learn from; 
- generally, most ML models can learn from examples they’ve seen before, but teaching the test doesn’t assure that the model can extrapolate to recognize data it has never seen before;
- the data that used to train the AI be kept separate for accountability and verification;

### Test set

- the test set is generally significantly smaller than the training set;

### Validation sets

- a small set of training data is set aside to make validation tests before letting the model train on an expensive infrastructure or for an elongated time;

## Tensors

- optimized data structure that allows for GPU and Web Assembly acceleration for immense AI/ML calculation sets; 
- Tensors are the numerical holders of data;

## Normalization

- is the action of scaling input values to a simpler domain; 
- when everything becomes numbers, the difference in sparsity and magnitude of numbers can cause unforeseen issues;

## Data augmentation

## Features and featurization

- is the selection of the features from all the possible data that could be selected as inputs;
