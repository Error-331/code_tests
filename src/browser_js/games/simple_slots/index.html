Most game engines have an event system, which permits various
engine subsystems to register interest in particular kinds of events and to respond to those events when they occur (see Section 16.8 for details). A game’s
event system is usually very similar to the event/messaging system underlying virtually all graphical user interfaces (for example, Microsoft Windows’
window messages, the event handling system in Java’s AWT or the services
provided by C#’s delegate and event keywords).


Some game engines leverage their event system in order to implement the
periodic servicing of some or all of their subsystems. For this to work, the
event system must permit events to be posted into the future—that is, to be
queued for later delivery. A game engine can then implement periodic updating by simply posting an event.

In the event handler, the code can perform whatever periodic servicing is required. It can then post a new event 1/30 or
1/60 of a second into the future, thus continuing the periodic servicing for as
long as it is required.

8.4 Abstract Timelines
In game programming, it can be extremely useful to think in terms of abstract
timelines. A timeline is a continuous, one-dimensional axis whose origin (t =
0) can lie at any arbitrary location relative to other timelines in the system. A
timeline can be implemented via a simple clock variable that stores absolute
time values in either integer or floating-point format.

8.4.1 Real Time
We can think of times measured directly via the CPU’s high-resolution timer
register (see Section 8.5.3) as lying on what we’ll call the real timeline. The
origin of this timeline is defined to coincide with the moment the CPU was
last powered on or reset. It measures times in units of CPU cycles (or some
multiple thereof), although these time values can be easily converted into units
of seconds by multiplying them by the frequency of the high-resolution timer
on the current CPU.


8.4.2 Game Time
We needn’t limit ourselves to working with the real timeline exclusively. We
can define as many other timeline(s) as we need in order to solve the problems
at hand. For example, we can define a game timelinethat is technically independent of real time. Under normal circumstances, game time coincides with real
time. If we wish to pause the game, we can simply stop updating the game
timeline temporarily. If we want our game to go into slow motion, we can update the game clock more slowly than the real-time clock. All sorts of effects
can be achieved by scaling and warping one timeline relative to another

Pausing or slowing down the game clock is also a highly useful debugging tool. To track down a visual anomaly, a developer can pause game time
in order to freeze the action. Meanwhile, the rendering engine and debug flythrough camera can continue to run, as long as they are governed by a different
clock (either the real-time clock or a separate camera clock). This allows the developer to fly the camera around the game world to inspect it from any angle
desired. We can even support single-stepping the game clock, by advancing
the game clock by one target frame interval (e.g., 1/30 of a second) each time a “single-step” button is pressed on the joypad or keyboard while the game is
in a paused state.

8.4.3 Local and Global Timelines


8.5
Measuring and Dealing with Time
In this section, we’ll investigate some of the subtle and not-so-subtle distinc-
tions between different kinds of timelines and clocks and see how they are
implemented in real game engines.
8.5.1
Frame Rate and Time Deltas
The frame rate of a real-time game describes how rapidly the sequence of still
3D frames is presented to the viewer. The unit of Hertz (Hz), defined as the
number of cycles per second, can be used to describe the rate of any periodic
process. In games and film, frame rate is typically measured in frames per second
(FPS), which is the same thing as Hertz for all intents and purposes. Films
traditionally run at 24 FPS. Games in North America and Japan are typically
rendered at 30 or 60 FPS, because this is the natural refresh rate of the NTSC
color television standard used in these regions. In Europe and most of the rest

of the world, games update at 50 FPS, because this is the natural refresh rate
of a PAL or SECAM color television signal.
The amount of time that elapses between frames is known as the frame time,
time delta or delta time. This last term is commonplace because the duration be-
tween frames is often represented mathematically by the symbol ∆t. (Techni-
cally speaking, ∆t should really be called the frame period, since it is the inverse
of the frame frequency: T = 1/ f . But, game programmers hardly ever use the
term “period” in this context.) If a game is being rendered at exactly 30 FPS,
then its delta time is 1/30 of a second, or 33.3 ms (milliseconds). At 60 FPS, the
delta time is half as big, 1/60 of a second or 16.6 ms. To really know how much
time has elapsed during one iteration of the game loop, we need to measure
it. We’ll see how this is done below.
We should note here that milliseconds are a common unit of time measure-
ment in games. For example, we might say that the animation system is tak-
ing 4 ms to run, which implies that it occupies about 12% of the entire frame
( 4/33.3 ≈ 0.12 ) . Other common units include seconds and machine cycles.
We’ll discuss time units and clock variables in more depth below.

8.5.2
From Frame Rate to Speed
Let’s imagine that we want to make a spaceship fly through our game world
at a constant speed of 40 meters per second (or in a 2D game, we might
specify this as 40 pixels per second). One simple way to accomplish this is
to multiply the ship’s speed v (measured in meters per second) by the du-
ration of one frame ∆t (measured in seconds), yielding a change in position
∆x = v∆t (which is measured in meters per frame). This position delta can then
be added to the ship’s current position x 1 , in order to find its position next
frame: x 2 = x 1 + ∆x = x 1 + v∆t.
This is actually a simple form of numerical integration known as the explicit
Euler method (see Section 13.4.4). It works well as long as the speeds of our
objects are roughly constant. To handle variable speeds, we need to resort to
somewhat more complex integration methods. But all numerical integration
techniques make use of the elapsed frame time ∆t in one way or another. So
it is safe to say that the perceived speeds of the objects in a game are dependent
upon the frame duration, ∆t. Hence a central problem in game programming
is to determine a suitable value for ∆t. In the sections that follow, we’ll discuss
various ways of doing this.

8.5.2.1
Old-School CPU-Dependent Games
In many early video games, no attempt was made to measure how much real
time had elapsed during the game loop. The programmers would essentially
ignore ∆t altogether and instead specify the speeds of objects directly in terms
of meters (or pixels, or some other distance unit) per frame. In other words,
they were, perhaps unwittingly, specifying object speeds in terms of ∆x = v∆t,
instead of in terms of v.

The net effect of this simplistic approach was that the perceived speeds of
the objects in these games were entirely dependent upon the frame rate that
the game was actually achieving on a particular piece of hardware. If this kind
of game were to be run on a computer with a faster CPU than the machine for
which it was originally written, the game would appear to be running in fast
forward. For this reason, I’ll call these games CPU-dependent games.

8.5.2.2
Updating Based on Elapsed Time
To make our games CPU-independent, we must measure ∆t in some way,
rather than simply ignoring it. Doing this is quite straightforward. We simply
read the value of the CPU’s high-resolution timer twice—once at the begin-
ning of the frame and once at the end. Then we subtract, producing an accu-
rate measure of ∆t for the frame that has just passed. This delta is then made
available to all engine subsystems that need it, either by passing it to every
function that we call from within the game loop or by storing it in a global
variable or encapsulating it within a singleton class of some kind. (We’ll de-
scribe the CPU’s high-resolution timer in more detail in Section 8.5.3.)

The approach outlined above is used by many game engines. In fact, I am
tempted to go out on a limb and say that most game engines use it. However,
there is one big problem with this technique: We are using the measured value
of ∆t taken during frame k as an estimate of the duration of the upcoming frame
( k + 1 ) . This isn’t necessarily very accurate. (As they say in investing, “past
performance is not a guarantee of future results.”) Something might happen
next frame that causes it to take much more time (or much less) than the current
frame. We call such an event a frame-rate spike.

Using last frame’s delta as an estimate of the upcoming frame can have
some very real detrimental effects. For example, if we’re not careful it can put
the game into a “viscious cycle” of poor frame times. Let’s assume that our
physics simulation is most stable when updated once every 33.3 ms (i.e., at
30 Hz). If we get one bad frame, taking say 57 ms, then we might make the mistake of stepping the physics system twice on the next frame, presumably to
“cover” the 57 ms that has passed. Those two steps take roughly twice as long
to complete as a regular step, causing the next frame to be at least as bad as
this one was, and possibly worse. This only serves to exacerbate and prolong
the problem.

8.5.2.3
Using a Running Average
It is true that game loops tend to have at least some frame-to-frame coherency.
If the camera is pointed down a hallway containing lots of expensive-to-draw
objects on one frame, there’s a good chance it will still be pointed down that
hallway on the next. Therefore, one reasonable approach is to average the
frame-time measurements over a small number of frames and use that as the
next frame’s estimate of ∆t. This allows the game to adapt to a varying frame
rate, while softening the effects of momentary performance spikes. The longer
the averaging interval, the less responsive the game will be to a varying frame
rate, but spikes will have less of an impact as well.

8.5.2.4
Governing the Frame Rate
We can avoid the inaccuracy of using last frame’s ∆t as an estimate of this
frame’s duration altogether, by flipping the problem on its head. Rather than
trying to guess at what next frame’s duration will be, we can instead attempt
to guarantee that every frame’s duration will be exactly 33.3 ms (or 16.6 ms if
we’re running at 60 FPS). To do this, we measure the duration of the current
frame as before. If the measured duration is less than the ideal frame time, we
simply put the main thread to sleep until the target frame time has elapsed.
If the measured duration is more than the ideal frame time, we must “take
our lumps” and wait for one more whole frame time to elapse. This is called
frame-rate governing.

Clearly this approach only works when your game’s frame rate is reason-
ably close to your target frame rate on average. If your game is ping-ponging
between 30 FPS and 15 FPS due to frequent “slow” frames, then the game’s
quality can degrade significantly. As such, it’s still a good idea to design all
engine systems so that they are capable of dealing with arbitrary frame dura-
tions. During development, you can leave the engine in “variable frame rate”
mode, and everything will work as expected. Later on, when the game is get-
ting closer to achieving its target frame rate consistently, we can switch on
frame-rate governing and start to reap its benefits.

To implement record and playback, we make note of every relevant event
that occurs during gameplay, saving each one in a list along with an accurate
time stamp. The list of events can then be replayed with exactly the same tim-
ing, using the same initial conditions and an identical initial random seed. In
theory, doing this should produce a gameplay experience that is indistinguish-
able from the original playthrough. However, if the frame rate isn’t consis-
tent, things may not happen in exactly the same order. This can cause “drift,”
and pretty soon your AI characters are flanking when they should have fallen
back.

8.5.2.5
Screen Tearing and V-Sync
A visual anomaly known as screen tearing occurs when the back buffer is
swapped with the front buffer while the screen has only been partially
“drawn” by the video hardware. When tearing occurs, a portion of the screen
shows the new image, while the remainder shows the old one. To avoid tear-
ing, many rendering engines wait for the vertical blanking interval of the moni-
tor before swapping buffers.
Older CRT monitors and TVs “draw” the contents of the in-memory frame
buffer by exciting phosphors on the screen via a beam of electrons that scans
from left-to-right and top-to-bottom. On such displays, the v-blank interval
is the time during which the electron gun is “blanked” (turned off) while it
is being reset to the top-left corner of the screen. Modern LCD, plasma and
LED displays no longer use an electron beam, and they don’t require any time
between finishing the draw of the last scan line of one frame and the first scan
line of the next. But the v-blank interval still exists, in part because video stan-
dards were established when CRTs were the norm, and in part because of the
need to support older displays.
Waiting for the v-blank interval is called v-sync. It is really just another
form of frame-rate governing, because it effectively clamps the frame rate of
the main game loop to a multiple of the screen’s refresh rate. For example, on
an NTSC monitor that refreshes at a rate of 60 Hz, the game’s real update rate

is effectively quantized to a multiple of 1/60 of a second. If more than 1/60 of
a second elapses between frames, we must wait until the next v-blank interval,
which means waiting 2/60 of a second (30 FPS). If we miss two v-blanks, then
we must wait a total of 3/60 of a second (20 FPS) and so on. Also, be careful
not to make assumptions about the frame rate of your game, even when it is
synchronized to the v-blank interval; if your game supports them, you must
keep in mind that the PAL and SECAM standards are based around an update
rate of 50 Hz, not 60 Hz.

8.5.3 Measuring Real Time with a High-Resolution Timer

All modern CPUs contain a high-resolution timer, which is usually imple-
mented as a hardware register that counts the number of CPU cycles (or
some multiple thereof) that have elapsed since the last time the processor
was powered on or reset. This is the timer that we should use when mea-
suring elapsed time in a game, because its resolution is usually on the order
of the duration of a few CPU cycles. For example, on a 3 GHz Pentium pro-
cessor, the high-resolution timer increments once per CPU cycle, or 3 billion
times per second. Hence the resolution of the high-res timer is 1/3 billion =
3.33 × 10 − 10 seconds = 0.333 ns (one-third of a nanosecond). This is more than
enough resolution for all of our time-measurement needs in a game.

Different microprocessors and different operating systems provide differ-
ent ways to query the high-resolution timer. On a Pentium, a special instruc-
tion called rdtsc (read time-stamp counter) can be used, although the Win32
API wraps this facility in a pair of functions: QueryPerformanceCounter()
reads the 64-bit counter register and QueryPerformanceFrequency() re-
turns the number of counter increments per second for the current CPU. On
a PowerPC architecture, such as the chips found in the Xbox 360 and PlaySta-
tion 3, the instruction mftb (move from time base register) can be used to read
the two 32-bit time base registers, while on other PowerPC architectures, the
instruction mfspr (move from special-purpose register) is used instead.

A CPU’s high-resolution timer register is 64 bits wide on most processors,
to ensure that it won’t wrap too often. The largest possible value of a 64-bit un-
signed integer is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF ≈ 1.8 × 10 19 clock ticks. So, on a 3 GHz
Pentium processor that updates its high-res timer once per CPU cycle, the reg-
ister’s value will wrap back to zero once every 195 years or so—definitely not
a situation we need to lose too much sleep over. In contrast, a 32-bit integer
clock will wrap after only about 1.4 seconds at 3 GHz.
